> This is an old sticky noted part of my notes. The theory's since developed more. Better to record something digitally than nothing though. I'm sure there are better excerpts with more detail. I like the ones later in the same notebook with diagrams going into special/general relativity. But, my only motivation for documenting this is pretty small. It's more interesting to develop than to document. I'd be more motivated if I had faith in the humanity and goodness of authorities in science and otherwise in the human race. The truth is, I kind of believe that anything I do would just be ~~used badly~~ ignored by people anyway, and don't see the point.

### anti-matter

1.) (anti/)neutrino polarity depends on proximity-weighted orthogonal component photon polarity

2.) adds and (negative for gravity component) squares to determine neutrino amplitude

3.) otherwise does nothing (or copies photon)

### Higgs field

Polarities of neutrinos scaled by proximity-weighted average of amplitudes=frequencies=momentums of photons

### Charge & spin (& magnetism) (& polarization)

– photon polarity independent from amplitude/frequency

– orthogonal plane to velocity, points in direction of angular acceleration (with perhaps corresponding magnitude as fraction of unit vector)

– polarities drift towards each other (gravitate) based on proximity (polarize)

– photons drift towards each other (attract) or away (repel) based on proximity and polarity dissimilarity (e.g. charge) and velocity similarity (e.g. spin and magnetism), attracting accordingly
