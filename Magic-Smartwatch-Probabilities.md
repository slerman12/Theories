# Magic Smartwatch Probabilities

**Wristwatch probabilities** are like your wrist but able to turn in full 360° motions. Your thumb points in the "polarity", capable of curling inward or stretching outward. Your arm is the velocity vector (unlike your arm, able to change size to represent the velocity magnitude).

The choice of left wrist or right wrist is arbitrary.

The phase-hand of the wristwatch on your wrist (like a minute-hand, but revolving in 360° circles at variable frequencies and with variable size representing a phase amplitude) has two dimensions: the probability dimension (from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock) and the polarity dimension (from midnight to 6), like "x" and "y" dimensions relative to you.

As the phase-hand turns at a given frequency, its magnitude in the probability dimension represents the sine wave-like nature of matter, and constructively and destructively interacts with other wristwatches that cross its location. For example, wrists (velocity vectors) intersect in space. One of them reads 1 o'clock, the other reads 7 o'clock. Both wristwatches have phase-hands of the same size/amplitude. Together, they destructively interfere (via vector addition/averaging of their phase-hands) to create a probability of 0, even though individually they both represent a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ (via the "probability", or relative-"x", dimension magnitude).

(In a more rigorous description, they can interfere differently depending on their relative orientation as well).

The polarity dimension (and angle) is ignored and can be regarded like an imaginary dimension for the purpose of computing probabilities. However, it will be used in a real, physical way in a moment to describe and unify the mechanisms of wave, spin, and polarization/or magnetism in particles and composite particles, as well as answer the mystery of Baryonic asymmetry.

If you like, wristwatch probabilities can be thought of as a more physical, real spinnor. Spinnors 2.0. Spinnors as physical objects in space that vote amongst each other through location dependent interference. No imaginary units. Actual orientations and phases (which can be attributed angular momenta and Larmor precession) radial to velocity.

Unit vector with a coefficient amplitude $A$, a rate of rotation $\frac{\partial \theta_\omega}{\partial t}$, a phase angle $\theta_\omega$ and a polarity angle $\theta_\mathrm{N}$ relative to a velocity vector $v$.

- The amplitude $A$ corresponds to the radius corresponds to the frequency corresponds to the momentum corresponds to $\frac{\partial \theta_\omega}{\partial t}$ ($A$ $\propto$ $f$ $\propto$ $p$ $\propto$ $\frac{\partial \theta_\omega}{\partial t}$, $t$ is time), in order to satisfy the common physics relations: $\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{v}{f}$, where $\lambda$ is wavelength, $h$ is [Planck's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant), and $p$ is momentum, which equals $mv$ for fermions, where $m$ is mass.
- A better way to visualize is a curve going into and out of space at varying orientations.
  - I think these "heads" are just going up and down in an independent concealed dimension and oriented in variable "polarity" ways perpendicular to velocity.
- The wristwatch just visually literalizes the math of that.
  - Or can be described as a vibrating compass.
  - Alternatively, the whole wristwatch ($A$, $\frac{\partial \theta_\omega}{\partial t}$, and $\theta_\omega$) can be replaced with a simple harmonic oscillator ($\frac{\partial^2 \alpha}{\partial t^2}$ $\propto$ $-f \alpha$, where $\alpha$ denotes the probability and polarity amplitudes), A.K.A. just your thumb curling in and out periodically.
- "Heads" are what I call these physical spinnors, as in, "heads belonging to a wave packet."
