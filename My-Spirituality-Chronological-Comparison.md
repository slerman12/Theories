At the core of my spirituality is the... observation... that humanity has severed its connection to nature.

We created a dichotomy between people and the earth, and from there arose every other dichotomy we’ve ever known.

Including the separation between ourselves and each other.

And the separation between heart, mind, and body.

That’s the accessible part.

The inaccessible part is that I believe the axis mundi of human consciousness has shifted since the dawn of civilization.

It shifted to the toolmaking faculties of our brains because civilization is a tool, and we’re conditioned to be always engaged with it from birth.

And now even our interactions with other people are facilitated foremost through language, a tool.

The part of our brain that had evolved for making fire and building stone weapons is now our primary means of connection with other human beings. Even body language has taken a backseat, consciously.

But these abstractions we live in that modulate our day to day functioning in society don’t have meaning on a subconscious level because this mode of consciousness is relatively young.

Just imagine, humans have been making fire for 300,000 years. The Stone Age is 3 MILLION years old. We’ve been making stone tools, clothing, and mild shelters for 3 million years! Civilization has only existed for 10,000 years. Up until that point, we had been living in tribal, nomadic hunting gathering communities. None of this is natural to us. The primal subconscious is an entire constellation of our being that we’re disconnected from.

When indigenous, tribal peoples are asked what plagues civilization, they say that man has severed his connection to spirit. 

To them, we look psychotic, which in many ways, we kind of are.

We live these pretend lives and we’re so conditioned to lie to ourselves that we’re not even aware that we’re doing it.

With civilization, mankind decided it was in our domain to control everything, including our own instincts. And we try to maintain that illusion of control at all costs. Our egos dominate to the point that we commit atrocities and utterly lose who we are. 

Anyway, I guess my spirituality, is trying to live honestly. I don’t need money or power or products to be happy and fulfilled. I need love and genuine human connection.

And a part of making that happen is being sincere and vulnerable with others even when it’s scary.

It also means feeling all of your emotions to their full extent, even the ones that don’t fit in with your worldview. Those are the ones that are trying to tell you something.

If you grow up in Nazi Germany, you develop a narrative in your head that certain people are inferior to other people. That idea has to be planted in the mind before it can reach the heart. But when your heart and mind are not separate, such a narrative is powerless.

My spirituality is about looking inside yourself — in the present moment — into your heart, and transcending the narrative, becoming one again with your humanity, which at its nature, I believe is good and compassionate. (And I have good reason to believe that. See: anthropological evidence from indigenous communities today, of whom in addition to their deep communal bonds and egalitarian nature, psychological studies show they are happier, less stressed, and un-afflicted with the mental illnesses that plague us.)

When this holistic, primal state of consciousness is achieved, the experience is like nothing else, and I believe it is the source of the oceanic feeling at the heart of religious experience and creative flow.

Beyond that, I take inspiration from eastern religion, transcendentalism, shamanism, Rousseau, Nietzsche, Marx, Jung, and Campbell.

> Aside form this last line, this essay best, better than any other, describes my spirituality

> I may have embellished some of these inspirations, besides Joseph Campbell and Jung, and sort of Marx, to make this seem more credible (though shamanism more generally, like not in academic expertise sense, was definitely, and what I've heard of the others, transcendentalism and Rousseau, and of course eastern religion, though Nietzsche was added in because someone I met liked him, and I haven't read much but appreciate his linguistic style)—the thing is, I came to these views on my own, and discovered these writers or movements already after. So less so "inspired by" and more so "maybe relate to, and want to ground my writing in established literature/beliefs"

There are people to feel

If you like me, I can like you

Those are the sacred knowings that justify living 

When I was younger, I sensed deep things about the universe, really profound things that can’t be summarized in physics theories or hard-headed language

I sensed a feeling that I can only interpret now as meaning those two things

Something about nature

Something about a deeper consciousness 

Some uncertainty knowing that there is a beauty beyond logic in the veils of things that I see and that we can touch/reach together

Today I can only analyze that sense/perception as meaning "there are people to feel”

In a really deep way

That there are good people to know who can know me back

Perhaps that there’s a purpose in the world

That there are thresholds/boundaries not crossed, but which are so important, so beyond expression important to discover and understand and perhaps cross or at least experience and see the other side of

That people have more to create

That we all have more to discover about each other

And that it’s worth it

And that there’s something deeper, something so good that I can’t even imagine what it is

Like grass or a squirrel or Chopin

Some hidden part of the universe, some hidden meaning 

One that isn’t destructible through logic or anxiety, but real

Yet what that is I can’t say because my logic has seemed to disprove it

And maybe what’s left to interpret of what it was is: There are people to feel

And "If you like me, I can like you”

And yet reducing that to a belief rather than a knowing means that these basic rights of human good and life and nature become fortunes that can be taken away by unattractiveness and anxiety and awkwardness  

Rather than the sacred meaning they’re supposed to have, as a higher good that is wiser and better than all of our human failings and strengths

The hidden veil of life’s preciousness becomes illusion

And the logic that those perceptions are just good emotions wins out

The privileged get to feel them in the right times

I never do

And life’s green grass dies, only to be deforested with fire, and left as dead acreage where no vegetation can grow—being wrong, that highest wisdom, and all the logic of the sadness of that preciousness goodness, being true—that while it’s felt, it’s so good, but the knowledge also that it’s illusion, behind which is a reality lacking in the depths imagined 

Logic rather than worthwhile meanings

Disappointment rather than discovery of new worlds

What I refer to now as cognition or conscious mind, I mean the same thing I did when I said ego

I’m just characterizing it differently in relation to what else exists

And "ego” captures a deeper iceberg and ocean that is going on

But I meant it like a really bad thing once—like there was a dissociation or psychosis and ego was the problem. The subconscious was the answer

That is a good perspective that brings meaning because it means that the deeper iceberg and ocean is wiser than the boat or the tip

Moreover, it meant the former were trying to help the latter

Today I see the two at war, the former sabotaging the latter, corrupt, using cynical and unethical, deleterious and identity-stealing tactics, with the former composed of intelligences that are less intelligent than me, my ego, and those intelligences are mechanical, almost artificial—predictable and maybe barely sentient—rather than God spirits of wisdom and beauty and the deeper iceberg and ocean

It’s more like ego in relation to id(s) and superego(s), both less intelligent and unattributable even the deeper wisdom of the ego (this is like the Freudian view), maybe some super being God working independent of the 3 as particles of a universe that’s more loving than its people (if not autonomous and unintelligent, too)

Jung’s view/cosmology is gone from my perception for the most part. I even have a notion of a superconscious to account for what I identify as a stupid subconscious 

The deeper iceberg and ocean now a lesser orchestra composed of vilifying ids

> This isn't really my spirituality—but it's now an unavoidable perception created in my psyche, and I mean to show how much 7 years has done to me from the ages of 22 to 29
