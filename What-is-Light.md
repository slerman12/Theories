# 3 Proofs

### (1)

Newton's 3rd law is violated by photons when it comes to their interaction with gravity. Gravity causes photons to "react" via centripetal acceleration towards masses, but the equal and opposite reaction isn't present (since photons don't have mass and therefore don't exert a force of gravity on masses such as electrons), meaning $F_\gamma$ $\neq$ $-F_{e^{-}}$, where $F_\gamma$ is the force on the photon by the electron, and $F_{e^{-}}$ is the force on the electron by the photon. 

Quick proof, since this requires considering a photon's momentum as "bending": the force on the photon, $F_\gamma$ $=$ $\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}$ $=$ $\frac{\partial \frac{hf}{c}}{\partial t}$, where $p$ is momentum, $t$ is time, $h$ is Planck's constant, $f$ is the frequency of the photon, and $c$ is the speed (or, in this case, arguably, since momentum is a vector quantity, velocity) of light, is non-zero because despite the usual scalar computation, the photon's momentum is a vector quantity (the direction of its velocity), so this value does not equal zero $\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}$ $\neq$ $0$ when the force of gravity bending it is applied (and therefore changing its velocity direction), and for that matter, this bend even accelerates with proximity to mass (e.g., according to the inverse-square law or general relativity). Thus, we have $0$ $\neq$ $\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}$ $=$ $F_\gamma$ $\neq$ $-F_{e^{-}}$ $=$ $0$, violating Newton's 3rd law, which requires $F_\gamma$ $=$ $-F_{e^{-}}$.

### (2)

EM $\neq$ light, and the probability distribution (the "wave function") of a photon is independent from its polarization orientation. 

The proof of this is simply that unpolarized light produces the usual double-slit diffraction interference pattern. If the orientation of its EM wave got summed in the computation of a photon's probability wave, then the probability waves of unpolarized light would always sum to 0 (destructively interfere, on account of arriving in all possible polarization orientations, including $180\degree$) where they would normally constructively interfere (even if they're in-phase). However, in diffraction experiments, unpolarized light constructively and destructively interferes. Therefore, the polarization orientation is independent from the probability interference. This validates its current discarding in the Schrödinger equation, but also clarifies a common misconception: often EM waves are portrayed as probability waves, but the way the EM waves interfere isn't and can't be the way the probability waves interfere.

This means EM $\neq$ light. The probability waves are not the EM waves.

### (3)

If the polarizations of electromagnetic waves cancel out in unpolarized visible light yet those photons still exert momentum even when not absorbed, then not only does light $\neq$ EM, but that light has a different source of momentum other than EM (e.g., a collision force):

</p>

The proof of this is that, if EM forces are canceled out, then the momentum standardly attributed to them ([see a good summary here](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX)) must have a different source.

A simple experiment to test this is whether unpolarized light in a double-slit experiment exerts momentum on optical rectennas placed in front of the constructively interfering portions of the projection screen. If so, then photons must have an independent source of momentum besides their EM, and besides the electron interaction which allows them to be absorbed by the projection screen, and then must also have the aforementioned bump (since the diffraction pattern confirms that the waves interfere and the unpolarized light gaurentees that the interfering waves have randomly conflicting EM forces, and so the latter on average must become negligible as the source for any momentum effects on the optical rectennas).

A simpler experiment is whether antennas work under two conflicting but in-phase polarizations (I am not aware if the results of such an experiment have been measured and are therefore known). Conflicting means polarized in $180\degree$ angles.

Note: electrons absorb photons, and that causes a momentum-like force exerted on them as well, due to a change in energy, besides the standardly attributed EM-caused momentum (summarized [here](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX)). This happens in projection screens, film, photodiodes, and proteins in the eyes that let us see called photopsins, but not in antennas. Antennas depend on a non-absorption based momentum from photons. Such momentum is typically attributed to EM forces (again, as summarized [here](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX)). But if a high intensity of unpolarized light can exert momentum even when not absorbed (no experiment has shown this, to my knowledge), then photons also carry an intrinsic momentum (e.g., a kind of collision force), besides the EM forces, which must get canceled out on average in sufficiently intense unpolarized light. I depict such a force with a kind of squeezed bell curve above, for [reasons described here](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Bendy-Ball.md).

# What is Light

If light has no momentum bump,

</p>

then how does matter get "pushed" by unabsorbed unpolarized light (if it does)? Shouldn't the momenta cancel out? Of course. The unpolarized waves destroy each other, as each polarization acts in destructive interference with each other.

At the very least, it means the probability distribution (the wave function) of the light wave is independent from the polarization direction/orientation, or else visible light — which is unpolarized usually (e.g., sunlight, fire) — wouldn't produce interference patterns. The probabilities due to the interference of polarizations would cancel out. Diffraction grating experiments show this isn’t the case.

And yet, even if photons materialize via the wave function independent from polarization's (or unpolarization’s) interference effects, how is it that the electromagnetic forces of unpolarized light compounds to “push” electrons? The electromagnetic forces are the only attributed source of a photon’s momentum, [usually](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX)[^1] and standardly, but the electromagnetic forces of intense unpolarized light must cancel out due to the destructively interfering polarizations, meaning, if the standard assumption is true, unpolarized light should have no momentum. Photoelectric effect experiments show this isn’t the case: unpolarized visible light, at sufficient frequency, is able to "push" electrons from the surface of a metal plate, even at high intensity, when those polarizations must cancel out on average. This “push” might arise from a photon’s absorption mechanics with the electrons, but this must then be a different source of momentum than the one standardly [attributed to electromagnetic forces](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX).

Meanwhile, antennas prove that electromagnetic waves interfere when destructively aligned, or at least their phases do, and the same principle can be generalized to sporadic polarizations (unpolarized photons), where conflicting in-phase but oppositely polarized photons should similarly interfere and on the average cancel each other out. However, if unpolarized photons still vibrate the antenna, then that means the photons must have an independent source of momentum besides their electromagnetic forces, since by Newton’s 2nd law, the electric forces add and the magnetic forces add, canceling each other out. Since they’re directed in opposite polarizations, those forces largely cancel out due to that addition. It's as if they’re out of phase even when they’re in phase. When those forces cancel out due to Newton’s 2nd law, that leaves no electromagnetic force whatsoever as an [attributable source](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX) of momentum, and yet that momentum of the photons is still standardly presumed to exist.

Then unpolarized light might reasonably have some other source of momentum for matter to be "pushed" by. Perhaps intrinsic momentum

not dependent on electromagnetic forces.

But Newton's 3rd law is violated by photons when it comes to their interaction with gravity. Gravity causes photons to "react" via centripetal acceleration towards masses, but the equal and opposite reaction isn't present (since photons don't have mass and therefore don't exert a force of gravity on masses such as electrons), meaning $F_\gamma$ $\neq$ $-F_{e^{-}}$, where $F_\gamma$ is the force on the photon by the electron, and $F_{e^{-}}$ is the force on the electron by the photon. 

Quick proof, since this requires considering a photon's momentum as "bending": the force on the photon, $F_\gamma$ $=$ $\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}$ $=$ $\frac{\partial \frac{hf}{c}}{\partial t}$, where $p$ is momentum, $t$ is time, $h$ is Planck's constant, $f$ is the frequency of the photon, and $c$ is the speed (or, in this case, arguably, since momentum is a vector quantity, velocity) of light, is non-zero because despite the usual scalar computation, the photon's momentum is a vector quantity (the direction of its velocity), so this value does not equal zero $\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}$ $\neq$ $0$ when the force of gravity bending it is applied (and therefore changing its velocity direction), and for that matter, this bend even accelerates with proximity to mass (e.g., according to the inverse-square law or general relativity). Thus, we have $0$ $\neq$ $\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}$ $=$ $F_\gamma$ $\neq$ $-F_{e^{-}}$ $=$ $0$, violating Newton's 3rd law, which requires $F_\gamma$ $=$ $-F_{e^{-}}$. (Either way, note, this is a tangent to the larger point).

So perhaps Newton's 2nd law (involving sums of forces) is also violated, but this'd be strange since that would imply that forces can accelerate in two conflicting directions without canceling each other out, as conflicting polarizations of two in-phase photons directs the electric and magnetic forces this way or that.

This multi-branched non-summation sounds like quantum mechanics, where two locations and directions of acceleration are allowed, at least probabilistically via the wave function. But then this branching would literally have to happen in antennas for them to work with two conflicting polarizations. But such a measurement would collapse the wave function, and the logic becomes moot.

Therefore, if antennas work under two conflicting but in-phase polarizations, then there is a bump.

If the polarizations of electromagnetic waves cancel out in unpolarized visible light yet those photons still exert momentum even when not absorbed, then this is a proof, of both that light $\neq$ EM and that light has a different source of momentum (e.g., that bump).

This is a proof of something else as well, regardless of any condition statement — though understated above, and not further discussed below — that the probability distribution (the "wave function") of the light wave is independent from the polarization orientation. The proof of this is simply that unpolarized light produces the usual double-slit diffraction interference pattern. If the orientation of its EM wave got summed in the computation of a photon's probability wave, then the probability waves of unpolarized light would always sum to 0 (destructively interfere, on account of arriving in all possible polarization orientations, including $180\degree$) where they would normally constructively interfere (even if they're in-phase). However, in diffraction experiments, unpolarized light constructively and destructively interferes. Therefore, the polarization direction/orientation is independent from the probability interference. This validates its current discarding in the Schrödinger equation, but also clarifies a common misconception: often EM waves are portrayed as probability waves, but the way the EM waves interfere isn't and can't be the way the probability waves interfere.

This means EM $\neq$ light. The probability waves are not the EM waves.

What I wrote earlier [here](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Disproof-and-Unified.md) (ignore the irrelevant lower fourth):

### Hypothetical Critiques

- Here's one possible critique: the forward momentum from conflicting polarizations don't interfere because both act in the direction of velocity. However, those forces are only because of the electric and magnetic fields (see [here](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX) for an explanation), which both depend on polarization and are both interfered with, so no. The electromagnetic "momentum" is cancelled out in unpolarized light, and there'd be no physical trace of a "push" without a corresponding absorption of the photon.
- An alternative critique is that those fields don't interfere with each other and two superimposed photons with opposite polarizations somehow independently affect the electron, but then there's the question of "in which order do they impart their two independent effects?" Given that those electric and magnetic vibrations are conflicting, by Newton's 2nd law, the forces cancel out if they happen concurrently (and if they don't, then the question of the universe's sequential order for every single compounding interaction happening not in parallel has to be answered and why we don't notice artifacts from those time delays, since the electron would have to do a full vibration before moving on to listening to the next photon in the sequence).
- Perhaps instead the force is some probabilistic average (expected value) of possibilities relying on the wave function, but then that average (expected value) is zero.

Photons have at least one other known property besides their electromagnetic (EM) effects and that's their interaction (absorption and emission) with electrons.

And that absorption and emission induces its own momentum delta. For example, when an electron transitions energy levels due to the absorption of photons, its momentum also changes.

Therefore, there is a subtler, more elegant alternative to imparting photons with momenta beyond just the EM effects, and that's defining/observing this absorption/emission energy-change interaction with electrons.

It's that interaction, and the subsequent energy excitations of electrons in proteins called photopsins, that allows our eyes to see, and this interaction is indeed independent to the photon's polarization.

So when it comes to visual perception of photons, this has a simpler[^2] resolution. The spacetime curve then becomes:

and the electron interaction, distinct from EM and independent to polarization, is responsible for color perception.

A simple experiment to test this is whether unpolarized light in a double-slit experiment exerts momentum on optical rectennas placed in front of the constructively interfering portions of the projection screen. If so, then photons must have an independent source of momentum besides their EM, and besides the electron interaction which allows them to be absorbed by the projection screen, and then must also have the aforementioned bump (since the diffraction pattern confirms that the waves interfere and the unpolarized light gaurentees that the interfering waves have randomly conflicting EM forces, and so the latter on average must become negligible as the source for any momentum effects on the optical rectennas):

More speculatively, frequency might have one other momentum-like effect that isn't reproducible via [electromagnetic push](https://youtu.be/bvzr2HbbPC8?si=wyctUUwiOc5dQgfX). Higher frequency should perhaps correspond to more resistance in light's bending towards centripetal accelerations/forces such as gravity, if the analogy to momentum is really taken to its extreme, while still respecting the constancy of the speed of light in its linear/inertial speed. I can regard this momentum of light then as an "inner velocity," by which centripetal forces are resisted. This inner velocity in my opinion likely determines the absorption or emission mechanics of the photon by the electron.

[^1]: Those channels are amazing by the way.
[^2]: However, a more thorough resolution can include both the electron interaction and the "momentum-bump," and, in a roundabout way not discussed here, answer Baryonic asymmetry, by modification of the EM field with respect to polarization and a more in-depth neutrino interaction.
