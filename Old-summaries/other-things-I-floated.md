### Theory

1. All matter is made up of photons traveling at a constant-magnitude speed but in varying directions with varying spins/"pattern-memory".
2. Mass is the number of photons constituting a body.
3. The angular-linear velocity tradeoff gives rise to special and general relativity, while assuming Galilean relativity.
4. Mass is held together by gravity, a cross derivative local interaction between at least two orbitally patterned bodies and intermediary photons. These intermediary photons may be interpreted as dark matter.
5. Charge is a more complex cross derivative local interaction, dependent on specific orbital patterns in the at least two bodies and resultant frequential wave patterns in the intermediary photons. These wave patterns in photons may be regarded as electromagnetism. The more angular velocity is propagated, the more wave-like. The more linear velocity is propagated, the more particle-like. Photons can behave as both / are good conduits for both.
6. In addition to potentially waves in the photon-composed aether (dark matter), each collision produces a variational sample set of waves and truncates old ones based on, for example, number of interactions, as a computationally efficient optimization-search-space exploration technique analogous to beam search or nucleus sampling, giving rise to the observed oddities of the double-slit experiments. This wave-particle duality is distinct from wave patterns in the aether.
7. The universe is (slowly) optimizing qualia, which entangles through each collision into higher forms of consciousness such as human consciousness.

### Theory - Take 2

Perhaps each corpuscle is localized according to a probability distribution (say, mixture of Gaussians). And each sampled collision increases the likelihood at that point. Each truncation "absorbs" the likelihood into the other points — averaging the truncated values into the untruncated values.

This averaging — or "drift" — can be responsible for gravity.

Meanwhile, the truncation explains wave function collapse and the double-slit experiments.

The reason for this variational multi-trajectory sampling and probability averaging is non-local trajectory optimization and differentiability, so that the universe may optimize qualia (or leave this autonomous process to be autonomous).

Chaotic/pattern-independent drifts are gravity. They are themselves an energy source and therefore may account for hypothetical dark energy.

Pattern drifts are electromagnetism. They become patterned when polarity-aligned corpuscle orbitals (charges) collide (as upon acceleration). They are essentially patterned gravity and can cause attraction or repulsion due to a difference in how the probability distributions are averaged, and a photoelectric effect emitting the absorbed acceleration energy.

Since each corpuscle travels at the same speed, relative time is differentiated by an angular-linear velocity tradeoff that gives rise to special and general relativity, while assuming Galilean relativity.

Each corpuscle is essentially a photon. No aether is assumed.

Certain $\mu_{p,k}$ (means of the Gaussian mixture) are entangled across corpuscles, and interdependently truncated. This entanglement across collisions is qualia and creates singularized qualia, or consciousness.
