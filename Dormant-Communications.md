One mystery in the consideration of the universe as having a dormant intelligence, is the scope of that intelligence. At its minimum, we know the universe's intelligence includes us as individuals, isolated or not.

Our individual intelligence can be plausibly said to connect to the planning and perceptions of others, if not solely via mechanistic communication or telepathically directly, then through some 3rd-party independent intelligence that can communicate us. People can debate this, if they haven't seen it for themselves. When enough abundant synchronicity data is witnessed and cautiously discerned as having too implausible a chance of being coincidental or accidental, then the conclusion that mechanisms of a wider intelligence network might exist, can be rationally made, as I've discerned from my own experience and am in the progress of writing up more specifically. 

The scope could vary in locality. The most-local being the individual, our own consciousness. Then next-local being those in our vicinity. Gradually, we can imagine the extension of this locality like a human neural network dormant in the wires of the universe, branching from one person to another, perhaps with telepathic or mediated communications prioritizing physical-space proximity, or perhaps entirely non-local and encompassing the wide scope of all people on Earth, or perhaps even wider and encompassing all lifeforms in the universe, or even beyond that, all particles in the universe, the physical universe itself, via stochastic modulations in a latent or non-local brain everywhere.

I've also seen evidence that whatever power exists, has some control over physics, especially more randomness-dependent outcomes, and especially in more sophisticated technologies like WiFi or AI recommender systems that heavily involve compounding-randomness but aren't so intelligent enough independently that they could possibly produce exactly the synchronistic disruption or content needed for a more general longitudinal thread in a spiritual journey...

This is hard to summarize, but the point is that there are different scopes of the possible intelligence of the universe. Is it a network that's localized to us humans on Earth, perhaps a physics bubble that our own network induces, or is it the universe itself and something that expands far beyond humanity, not in isolated bubbles, but in the vast scope of the unified cosmos?

The challenge of accepting that is, well firstly, the premise itself, if data for any sort of non-local communications and physics interventions isn't presented, but supposing I satisfied the reader's skepticism in presenting that data, there's the second challenge of contemplating how big the scope of such a God would/could be, since the universe is so big.

As DarkMatter2525 shows, our planet spatially is an infinitesimal blip, with a human-centric temporal scope that can be regarded as less than the blink of an eye.

And while that scrutiny can be answered by proposing that God's attention is prioritized towards complexity, in particular the complexity of sophisticated and rich relative consciousness experiences...

...and with a larger human-centric time scope left to come, as time progresses to justify the emptiness of the past and fill in the spatial emptiness with our expansion into the stars in the future...

It's still absurd to imagine that all of that space beyond is connected within the intelligence of a being who is predominantly focussing on us as central to that being's designs and attention, or that we might be connected to other such sub-networks of species far beyond in galaxies incomprehensible through that same being, all entangled (or not) and planning together.

With all that intelligence, it's hard to imagine [*why* unethical realities might still exist on the face of this human-centric blip of a planet, and the reasoning for the laws of physics as they are](Consciousness.md#cosmogenesis-myth).

### Why wouldn't non-local intelligence(s) prove themselves by communicating, for example, an SOS signal when somebody is stranded?

The SOS signal guy would then be rescued, and the prophet who found him would then be exalted. Maybe if this happened once, it would be dismissed as coincidence. But if every SOS signal guy had a corresponding prophet find him, that would be historic, and would change history. That change would have to be the controlled, planned one. But then that specific framing would have to justify itself—why reveal the physics of the universe that way specifically? Seems to be sort of disconnected from any history or current events. It’s not a good or relevant story/narrative/myth to change all of history and science by. And on top of that, such regular interventions across all stranded people would have to justify why other problems in the world aren’t divinely intervened on with exemption to ordinary physics, why the distribution of those interventions seeming to demonstrate God’s love is actually so unjust, as war, disease, environmental pollution continue, all also hypothetically stoppable by God, but then humanity wouldn’t learn how to be intelligent under autonomous physics wherein God’s intervention, the compounding effects of which have so many interactions, can be towards individual purposes someday, and the collective and system can be autonomously good, since otherwise each intervention to make them good results in a butterfly effect of constant intervention, which has a cost, since the point of this autonomous physics is to allow God to distribute Himself into the divisions, enjoy the experiences, and enjoy creating good ones rather than micromanaging away the massive issues constantly that ideally his divided experiences—humanity—would have the wisdom to solve. 

But can’t the SOS stranded person promise to keep being saved a secret? Yes, and often such rescues happen. Usually the [metaphorical] prophet isn’t even made conscious of their unlikelihood of having found the [metaphorical] stranded person. Subconscious and superconscious kind of limit awareness often for that purpose, as God’s interventions do sneak beneath the eye of periphery [under the ego's nose]. 

But the more that happens, either the stupider people have to become in not noticing, or the more subtle God has to become in making the interventions smaller, less perceptible, compared to saving an SOS stranded person via a prophet realizing suddenly that person’s location. [Or every SOS stranded person as such]. 

[Those downsides are true,] Unless that were the planned, controlled path [for specific people and prophets]. 

Then, such physics teachings can proceed, and they would’ve been planned to account for all of these concerns [about the autonomous physics becoming good] as much as possible. 

### Universe As God, More Religious

Another point is that, God isn’t causing the injustices (usually), and that inaction only reveals what the system can do, the human system, the human knowledge, the processes autonomous to God’s interventions, but God probably does intervene when His interventions can better show the nature of those problems in the existing behaviors, safeguards, and designs of humankind. Otherwise, people either wouldn’t address those issues or learn how to independently identify and address them: In the scope that God is planning for, of billions of years and more, these past millions of human existence—only a small thousand of years of Neolithic human existence—only a small set of billions of the universe, according to modern cosmology—the best interventions are ones which do not absolve the independent, autonomous system. Any amount of mass preferentialism risks humanity attributing (and thereby justifying) injustice to God, for why else would God have averted it in one case but not another? The only kind of preferentialism that might avoid carrying this risk is towards such an extremely rare set of cases that there can be no doubt that God is more than willing to allow humanity, if they do not reform, to commit atrocities that He strongly disapproves of, thereby putting the onus of not just reform, but learning how to reform, on the system itself so that it can be autonomous morally, so that the divided parts of Him who run it—us, humanity—are (one day) able to reflect the wisdom and love that He has, adaptively for everybody. 

Interventions and condescensions do happen, constrained though, through extreme planning, to satisfy the much larger-scope goal of humanity’s evolution towards governing themselves and each other justly, as He would, with His wisdom. 

Over the billions of years and more of consideration, the manner of limitation in His current interventions and condescensions makes the most sense, while keeping in accord with a finite divergence threshold for the probabilistically biased mechanical physics. 

That threshold is justified by its beauty in the future, as well as the past and present, allowing His divided experiences—e.g., humanity—to control and predict the cosmos as He would, and for them to do so in a way that He can enjoy, not just rule, for in the infinitum His plan is gardened, not blueprinted so that He too may enjoy it. 

A Tower of Babel is a temporary thing. The goal, ultimately, is a Garden of Eden sans any injustice. Humanity, even in primal times, when Earth was the Garden and before the babbling early river valley civilizations were rooted (e.g., in Babylon), and the languages of love between people and nature divided into babble (as in, "bla bla bla"), there were problems—and all of this is an arduous process to resolve them, as an arc of time bends back to its starting point but with knowledge of justice. 

The fruit of knowledge—in humans.

### What is the Knowledge of There Even Being Such a God—an Intelligent Super Being—Anyway?

That seems redundant, and contrary to the default assumption. Isn't lack of theism the default of assumption?

In humanity, no. Animism is the default assumption.

In logic, definitely no. [More elaboration here](Consciousness.md#cosmogenesis-myth), but to quote different elaboration of my own:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> Cosmologists have asked for centuries, *"How did something arise from nothing?"* It's a good question. After all, it assumes the most general origin state: nothing. If it assumed *something*, as in, something specific, e.g. "God" or "the universe pretty much as it is," we'd have to ask, "Well, how did we get *that* extremely specific thing?" "Nothing" is assumed in the question as the default assumption for its least loss in generality.
>
> However, there is another assumption tied to nothing in generality: and that's *everything*, including grief, bliss, misery, agony, and suffering. Infinite amounts of everything, all at once. Infinite joy and infinite peace and infinite pain.
>
> Now, "nothing" succumbs to a pretty apparent fallacy. For something to arise from nothing, a function that transforms nothing into something must exist. But that function is in itself something, so our "nothing" assumption is contradicted as soon as any such function is introduced.
>
> One might posit different origins besides "nothing" and "everything" equally general perhaps, such as cyclicality or infinite "turtles all the way down," but these are all specific somethings and cannot be said to be as general as the two mentioned, leaving the same mysteries, arguably no more general than assuming as default our own universe exactly as it is elementarily outright: "Where did the cycle come from?" or "Where did the infinite recursive turtle-stack come from?"
>
> But assuming everything gives us a path forward.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

I described that path with some more specifics [here](Consciousness.md#cosmogenesis-myth).


### Logic

> To do: Maybe something more formal deduction-based: In logic, one can’t assume "no assumption." "No assumption" would also be an assumption. One can only assume the axioms that incur the least loss in generality. "Nothing" is not the lack of an axiom, but an axiom. "Everything" is not the lack of an axiom, but an axiom. Both are defined only in relation to each other, as opposites. One cannot exist without the other, no more than the backward direction can if there’s no forward direction. "Nothing" is distinct from empty space—it’s undefinable without an "everything" in reference to it.
>
> An assumption/axiom is always "a loss in generality," and "a loss in generality" is always an assumption/axiom.

### The Huge Value of Atheism and Skepticism

> To do: Add something like this: I was an argumentative atheist, without two experiences atheists are most right, the first being an explanation for how it’s possible—but that’s not enough because billions of miles away there could be an alien planet of Amazon warriors; that doesn’t mean it’s true—and the experience of telepathy and synchronicities, the consciousness depth, no anxiety, transcendence I was experiencing in the House on May St. when I also realized, through my studies of artificial intelligence, not any religious person’s reasoning, how it’s possible. Religious people, like Job’s friends who argued with him and thought he was blaspheming, are more wrong because their justifications for their views are wrong. They bring injustice to just conclusions. Atheists have decisions based on all of physics to contend with and the observed consistency of that physics, gravity and electromagnetism not being really up for rational debate. A skeptic is useful for their ability to answer specifics, and justly

### Why Not a More Pleasant Universe Where, Instead of Our Physics, is Just Happiness?

> To do: Also add some point, on the question of why not create a universe of only pleasure, about given the choice to have a morphine drip, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a movie where Jim Carrey forgets all of his pain, and forget your grandparents, and parents, and griefs and heartaches and rejections, and have a morphine drip for the rest of your life, starting today, would you do it? Would your highest wisdom do it? So if not, perhaps for the same reason, the universe was not chosen as a morphine drip only

> And if haven't enough already, specify how the intelligent super being can interact with universe through limited statistical divergence of quantum particle sampling, without breaking the known and observed laws of nature (that sufficiently explains it, "limited statistical divergence of quantum particle sampling")

### So God is Avoiding Preferentialism?

> To do: Maybe another reason for consistency of physics, is so that history and memory can be perennial. The dumbest example I can think of, is so that TV shows from the 1900s and 2000s stay relevant in the 3000s and so on. 
>
> There might be deeper patterns that construct the "monomyth," the structures at the root of stories and psychological meaning, from archetypes to specific transitions/transformations, and perhaps poetic symmetry between those and physics—people/social patterns as images of physics, not just abstractly-God, and for that perennial story to exist yesterday, today, and tomorrow might have a stricter divergence limit constraint, than would be justified by "avoiding preferrentialism" and "biases" alone.

> And need to point out how many interactions there are to account for, and why divided experiences are better than just a singular one, resulting in those many interaction problems
