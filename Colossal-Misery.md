### Introduction

We are on the surface of a 4D sphere (hyper-sphere). Like the Earth, every direction on that sphere leads back to itself.

From our perspective, that surface is flat. Since we cannot leave its surface into a 5th dimension, if no 5th dimension exists, the only way to know that each of our 3 spatial coordinates is circular is to traverse the whole cosmos or stare at an unexpectedly close horizon, beyond even that which light's propagation speed would predict. Or, to discount the trappings of spacetime, transcend time, and observe — high up in the heavens — on our temporal-airplane that the edge indeed curves.

Of course, one could hope to discover this spherocity by shooting a laser and finding its incident light behind you — many years later. But this is not the case since, unless very, very lucky in your aim, that photon would be long obstructed before illuminating your back.

Furthermore, any measure of light's speed would be indistinguishable under the bias of this curve. One clue to its absolute speed might be in reference to the sphere's 3D expansion, accounting for that 5th dimension, time, and its ongoing expansion. Though, notably, time is just the sliding of particles on the edge of that 4D sphere that does not pertain to that geometric space but the locations of points on it. By creating little bends in that 4D sphere e.g. a fifth dimension, we can envision earth-like gravity causing the massive particles to attract as they do in our 3D space. But though this simplifies gravity to the earth-like force and topology we're familiar with, it does not explain it. No more so than Einstein's geometric depiction. You see, we are still assuming gravity! *One gravity does not explain another!*

However, if you ever find yourself drifting too far on your rocketship, like the explorer Magellan, you may be called to complete the return journey without changing course.

### Time and space

Interestingly, repulsion in this 4D space can be imagined as an upraising of a hill between the two charged particles — flying on a bend created in their tail directions. Like dirt lifted from behind both bodies to create a mound in front of them. A gravitational hole is thus appearing behind them to borrow forwards the big bump in front of them and between them. The space is lifting up between them. This collision is like an inversion of their individual gravities. Is repulsion the collision force at a non-local distance?

The orbital patterns are like circles on the edge of the sphere. They are, more literally, edges of the hyper-sphere.

A 2D cyclical space would represent orbits as 2D circles on 3D sphere. A 3D cyclical sphere would represent orbits as 3D spheres on a 4D hypersphere.

For conservation sake in collisions and in general, the uplifting of space can be proceeded at a constant velocity and with conserved density axis with local connectedness.

The universe as one big bouncy ball.

whose contours are defined by entangling qualia/genius (in the spatial memory) called particles.

Ah, but the particles are sampled. so that ball's shape is not defined.

That "bump" however is a bit like an inversion. Like the squaring of of 2 negatives into a positive — a such bigger positive that the curve folds the other way.

Densities square. - is mass, + is dark matter. They don't sum — they multiply. Negative times negative is positive. Mixture/product of Gaussians, with probabilities — capable of being negative — multiplied. Subtract .5 &nbsp;&nbsp;  or use logits at that point multiplied as density &nbsp;&nbsp; and multiply. Already normalized, already a probability distribution. But how to sample <- per particle -> each is &nbsp; sample &nbsp; is a different probability distribution/sphere

-> Next give the surface downward gravity — the particles may travel as such — maybe: no velocity is needed — emerges

-> At each time step sample a different sphere

-> optimize purely by entanglement, truncating and sampling

-> The spheres closest to your objective function survive

-> Threads can be kept track of to do this more intelligently

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; somewhere in that density soup is electromagnetism.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the effective negative direction half of those logits is physical matter

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the positive direction oscillation is probably electromagnetism since it costs nothing once it begins

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so perhaps the density has its own rhythm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the positive likes to sink downward. this is gravity

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the logits are multiplied pairwise to produce quadratic logits

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then some of these must be truncated

But how do you multiply Gaussians spatially with respect to x, y, z? their probabilities at each point. Their logits at each point.

Well, by multiplying. But how do you sample? Also by multiplying.

-> sample each individually and multiply their respective probabilities for one another or a common point to get the density -> normalized logits

logits: [-1, 1] 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or unbounded

~~with maybe a constant normalization toward 0~~ and particles navigating the space according to direction of least density

Velocity/change:

$$p_{x_{t+1}}^{(i)} = p_{x_{t}}^{(i)} - \frac{\partial D(p, i)}{\partial p_{x_{t}}^{(i)}} \text{   } = \frac{\partial p_{x_{t}}^{(i)}}{\partial t}$$

emergent collisions and gravity and conservation.

the density depends on all of the particles (their multiplication) and the individual particles depend on the previous density of their local 4D space [<- note: not spacetime] surface

it's a surface that rounds back in on itself.

frequency is like oscillating/inverted

On a 3D sphere [- 2D circular space], it's hard to imagine electromagnetism emerging e.g. on the surface of the earth, even with hilltops changing. Who knows. In 3D space (4D surface of sphere) such patterns are impossible to imagine, perhaps more likely.

Perhaps as two orthogonal particles orbit, one *sometimes* squares the other, one sometimes negative-squares the other, traversing at $c^2$ (one revolution per time unit) as the speed-constant.

Then isotropy might still be possible. But individual particles would be invisible and these would have to be adaotive. by emergence?

we can directly map this hyper-sphere to a 3D universe for visualization by just allowing the arbitrarily-chosen edge points to cycle as the visualized particles pass them

-- Like constructing a flat earth geometry from the round earth
-- From the perspective of 3D spacetime, it can be argued in fact that the Earth is flat.

hypersphere, gravity, emergent collisions, conservation of energy + momentum <br>
special relativity derivation

We can easily constrain a row of the 2D-mapped visualization of a 3D sphere space surface to be a blockade by setting a fixed array of particles along that line whose positions and densities (negative logits) don't update. We can then create a double-slit. And observe the patterns on the other end's screen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picture of setup

A ton of different worlds can be maintained at once, sampled, resampled, and truncated, mixing in ways that are altogether different yet wholly consistent. Multi-heads per particle, sampled per particle, updated including their entangled truncation score, and truncated.

A single particle can therefore produce its own wave distribution.

These truncations, depending on for example the distances to other particles, can cause collapse upon measurement due to sudden entanglement with the measuring device creating a disproportionately more favorable truncation score for that branch of the sample possibilities.

Maybe inertia:

$$
\frac{\partial p_{x}^{(i)}}{\partial t} = \begin{cases} 
      - \frac{\partial D(p, i)}{\partial p_{x}^{(i)}} & \text{ if } \neq 0 \\
      \text{whatever it was before at } t-1 & \text{ else} \\
\end{cases}
$$

derivative representation no longer works:

$$p_{x_{t+1}}^{(i)} = p_{x_{t}}^{(i)} + p_{v_{t}}^{(i)} - \frac{\partial D(p, i)}{\partial p_{x}^{(i)}}$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|____| 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for smoothness <-- more general

$p_{v_{t+1}}^{(i)} = p_{v_{t}}^{(i)} - \frac{\partial D(p, i)}{\partial p_{x}^{(i)}}$

or

$$
\frac{\partial p_{x}^{(i)}}{\partial t} = \begin{cases} 
      p_{v_{t}}^{(i)} & \text{ if } \neq p_{v_{t+1}}^{(i)} = 0 \\
      p_{v_{t+1}}^{(i)} & \text{ else} \\
\end{cases}
$$

perhaps double derivative representation would work

gravity should be a downward acceleration!

$$\frac{\partial^2 p_{x}^{(i)}}{\partial^2 t} = -\frac{\partial D(p, i)}{\partial p_{x}^{(i)}}$$

We thus obtain Newton's kinematics?

The $K$ heads multiply in the total probability distribution, but only the sampled one affects gravity.

Iteratively, they affect gravity as if a wave function.

All need to show: Special relativity could emerge from corpuscles on a surface of 4D hyper-sphere. Gravity hypothetically causes the corpuscle orbital patterns, not the other way around. Orbits are assumed emrgent from gravity. ] postulate-ish

space is a jiggly circle. time is the way it jiggles. and the circle exists in many possible states at once.

i think collision proximity is determined by the speed constant and initially, they just wiggle back and forth maybe causing more sporadacity

a.k.a. inertia and collisions

gravity however becomes stronger with stronger concentrations somehow glued/orbitally together

i think this effect can be more pronounced in 3D. start with 5 particles and see if they can be optimized to hold together in one location.

invent an elementary particle. or a photon

The quare of shape between two particles should change the shape behind them, but only when they're close enough, or repulsion

A gravity should add the two densities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and normalize

Repulsion multiplies.

So within certain distance repulsion

Otherwise gravity

both can be multiplied. gravity can always be positive and negated. Now it has twice the influence of repulsion I think

gravity can $Nx$ the influence and be added. repusion can have more influence in proximity by multiplication ("squaring")

together maybe they can create a harmonized density oscillation

also velocity is always unit normalized. Only the direction ultimately changes.

or just give non-gravity a smaller standard deviation. make it positive. add it to gravity. v/\v

The smaller the standard deviation of the Gaussian the smaller the collision distance.

electromagnetism somehow hacks this.

$$\frac{\partial^2 \delta_{x}^{(i)}}{\partial^2 t} = -\frac{\partial D(p, i)}{\partial p_{x}^{(i)}}$$

$$\frac{\partial p_{x}^{(i)}}{\partial t} = \lVert \frac{\partial \delta_{x}^{(i)}}{\partial t} \rVert$$

elliptical orbits allow light to exist

at the right angle at an even proportion of gravity and non-gravity oscillation, 2D or 3D.

what is 3D for...? electrons... maybe

We are waves on the surface of a 4D Globe [ pulled up by the distant non-gravity of some impossible to conceive 4D moon and down by gravity ] - not minimally/literally (analogy) - collision energy

Let's take a look at what happens when these particles form orbital patterns

Hypothetically, a photon's frequency may be its oscillation between gravity states and non-gravity states. Since its mass is zero, we want an orbital pattern that gives equal parts - (gravity) as + (non-gravity, or "collision energy").

Two diameter-intersecting circles would not do since the ration between gravity and non-gravity for perfect orthogonal circles would be constant. --> --> Requires 3D! ((

Thus elliptical patterns of some curvature or angle are required.

For the time being, to simplify the consideration, we will ignore how the elliptical patterns — like whirlpools in this 4D ocean —  have formed, but by some interaction in teh changing gravity space, akin to literally planetary systems, they have stabillized.I guess that is a sufficient explanation.

If gravity and collision density were not oscillating equally, the equal-mass corpuscles would collide and fly apart, in the trivial formulation of say, just two corpuscles.

Thus for such a pattern to stablize we derive what a mutually-elliptical pattern (perhaps 3 are required) would look like such that the total gravity/non-gravity oscillates between ~~some negative proportion and some positive proportion without loss of each other~~ positive and negative a constant factor.

This is a bit like Newton's $\partial x, \partial y$ graph for oscillating orbital patterns

<draw a circle with $\partial x, \partial y$ demarked> infinitesimal alterations that stabilize -> a little bit that way, a collision (+ inertia), -> a little bit that way, a attraction such that collision and attraction are equal

For the last, an elliptical pattern might be more likely. ?

This would be a really sensitive particle

Perhaps

<draw circles of 3D particle circling> ?

sphere of particles condensed somehow

note: can optimize two such spheres to repel.

<br>

maybe instead of gravity and non-gravity, these corpuscles oscillate by default. (Light) <br>
and by elliptical patterns from mass. — how?
<br> - also by default they would not necessarily collide. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; then might collide according to 50%/50% statistics individually and maybe more complex ones en-masse

an oscillating pattern would be a sine pattern of the logits?

A bump in a circle might be better than Gaussians for circular coordinates

< a circle with an upwards bump at the top > <- proba distribution

A circle with a bump: how to define, how to sample.

(See "circular distribution") --->

proba of $\theta$

but how to oscillate - if doing that

std can go up and down and absolute value based on its period

---> See "Wrapped Normal disribution"  

the truncation score can be made differentiable 

$\frac{\partial D(p, i)}{\partial p_{x}^{(i)}}$ is entirely differentiable derivative of sum of wrapped Normals with respect to $x$ can be computed in closed-form
