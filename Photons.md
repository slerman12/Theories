Photon probabilities as multi-head oscillators with memory traces. Localizable, Markovian.

Technically any entangled composition of matter.

Entanglement (due to interactions, e.g., non-zero derivatives) as consciousness singularization model.

Can use fermion (W), photon (_/\\\_), and oscillating logit "heads" to model.

Works for single photon interference case and varying projection screen distances.

The Schrodinger equation helps predict the resulting interference pattern in multi-slit diffraction experiments. If photons are projected continuously through a grating, the resulting interference pattern on the projection screen on the other side is analogous to the kind produced by multiple interfering waves, such as when regular intervals of ripples in water meet with each other on the surface of a pond. Recreating such a pattern is easy. Disturb a number of locations in the water at a regular frequency and the resulting ripples will construct and destruct upon each other as if they were mirroring the phenomenon of the observed projection screen in the multi-slit light experiment.

But here I make some key critical obsrevations. Though this wave explanation makes sense post-hoc, the actual logistics are mystified. I asked myself, is each photon a ripple expanding outwards, or does each photon represent all of the ripples as they all expand outwards? In either case, I reach the following conundrum: if photons are being emitted from a source at sporadic irregular rates in large numbers, then these ripples wouldn't be evenly spaced. One wave distribution upon another would produce a different pattern than explained post-hoc by measurement. Therefore the source must emit photons either (1) concurrently, and/or (2) at exactly the phase interval of the wavelength, so as the unique wave distributions of the photon can supercede atop each other in the ordered pattern that explains the measured result.

However, by assuming these 2 restrictions, as well as answering why they might be, we can reach a much simpler theory of light and quantum field distributions, one that is (a) easier to program and simulate, and (b) more intuitive due to its absolutely-localizable and Markovian properties, at least from a given reference frame (so as not to involve special relativity considerations quite yet).

If (2) is satisfied:

$\Uparrow$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\Uparrow$</br>
︵ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ︵</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\Uparrow$ </br>
︵&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;﹍&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp; ︵</br>
</br>
︵&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;﹍&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;︵

as expected to explain the final interference pattern result.

If (2) is not satisfied, we get:

$\Uparrow$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\Uparrow$</br>
︵ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\Uparrow$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ︵</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ﹍ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ﹍</br>
︵&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ︵</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;﹍&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;﹍</br>
︵&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;︵

and an even bigger mess with more out-of-phase photons.

Under the same constraint, we could also obtain all the equivalent explanatory patterns by considering each photon as its own ripple, and each phase corresponding to the emission of about the same quantity of photons who all share and construct this ripple structure.

For example, one way to produce light is to ue a crystal oscillator as the light source. Each major acceleration in the oscillation can correspond to the most concentrated emissions of such ripples that construct on each other in this regular phase pattern. Since the crystal's oscillation is regular, so is the wave pattern produced in proportion to its acceleration disturbances.

In other words, the quantity of the emitted photons approximately corresponds to the peaks and troughs of the ripples, and their individual distribution position can be (as is commonly explained, on this latter point) estimated by that distribution.

Those ripples do not disappear upon collision with the projection screen, as a single localized photon perhaps would, but keep spreading out, interfering, constructing, and destructing, as the water wave would. Physicists are then led to believe that the photon itself is that wave distribution (either a single ripple or the whole geometry) but the two observed assumptions we started with actually make this behavior sufficient, but not necessary, compared to a simpler one.

By observing the assumption that the photon emissions must correspond in phase — that is, their emitted quantities are actually proportional to the wave amplitudes — we can obtain the same pattern with easy-to-program-and-simulate and absolutely localizable point particles without the mind-boggling analogy to water waves, which — though beautiful — is really expensive to simulate with a computer in real-time when that wave's interactions (caues and effects) along its many-rippled paths play out, with no exact location defined for those interactions happening everywhere all at once affecting the rest of the distribution and its coherence at each time step.

The model I provide loses no generality in teh measured results of multi-slit diffraction experiments, and can be wrapped around in one's mind. And simulated in real-time on an ordinary MacBook Pro. And is elegant and beautiful enough that it could plausibly and comfortably be argued as light's true nature.

Aside: does the time-dependent Schrodinger equation even describe expanding ripples/moving waves, or are those distributions mostly stationary? Defining them stationary, everywhere all at once, doesn't change the result. Hence from my model, multi-heads that trace linear such oscillations (and with memory traces) suffice. 
- In fact, single head would suffice but then perhaps longer memory required
- num heads-memory computation tradeoff

The question is, why the inner proba oscillation corresponds to the crystal oscillator's emission oscillation. The answer: because those accelerations determine "inner velocity" $\rightarrow$ amplitude $\rightarrow$ frequency. So there is a mechanical one-to-one correspondence between the crystal's emissions and the heads' own frequencies.

Can explain this more conventionally by $p=h\lambda$ (more crystal acceleration means more photon quanta but also more momentum from those photons and therefore proportional frequency). So the faster the perceived oscillation/wavelength, the faster the inner one of the heads, making all predictive computations proportional.

Since the heads are point particles, we have the advantage of tractability (and depending on what the Schrodinger equation describes, localizability and Markov property). Such an oscillating point wave is also closer to the one typically visualized in EM/electrodynamics (and capable of polarization), and lends itself easier (hypothetically) to unification with special/general relativity, without the need for spinnors, since point particles can just be given the same treatment as larger masses in their relativistic behavior without contradiction or further unification needed (except to perhaps explain the existence of antimatter, which was previously derived via Dirac's wave equation with spinnors).

However, without this regular oscillation assumption (e.g. sunlight, right?), then the photon distribution pattern remains mystified, as each photon contibutes to potentially conflicting components of the total distribution, as visualized above with two photons in-phase vs. out-of-phase, and the post-hoc Schrodinger/Dirac explanation is no longer satisfactory since the individual quanta can no longer be identified except maybe [like this](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Quantum-sampling.md).

Perhaps sunlight and tested experiment light sources satisfy this criterium, in which case we have a solid unification of photons/quantum mechanics/field theory with SR/GR.

However, that seems unlikely, since why would photons always be evenly spaced out, especially with sunlight.

Maybe their phases align when they interact with the slits. But the interaction with the inner edges of the slits doesn't necessarily happen.

I guess they're just excitations of the sea, no quantity defined (until later interaction with projection screen, depending on excitation). How is single- vs. multi- photon determined?

Then again, frequency [is measured by interference patterns](https://qr.ae/pssSe1) so we might have the concept backwards and simple multi-head oscillator probabilities with head-sampling would suffice to reproduce all of this. Frequency would have to be discounted as just momentum, which is consistent with $p=f\lambda$.

So I guess this conclusive unification is possible if we accept all instances of "frequency" in light as being indirect, e.g., via interference patterns or effects on other atoms as in an atomic clock. Otherwise, the only way to measure such a head's frequency would be to measure its momentum. No direct frequency measurement should be possible with current methods/knowledge in such a nature. But then there would be no Doppler effect...? Since momentum should stay constant...? No, momentum is speed-relative.

[Disentangling the oscillation from the photon-quantity](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Quantum-sampling.md) might be able to resolve these issues, assuming still that the photons/multi-heads are at least in-phase when they reach the slits, which I suppose is the case if they're emitted from the same source location with the same starting phase. This is still dubious why they would always be in-phase at all slits from different angles, e.g. with a sunbox. I guess it's an analogous question to: Why do the ripples begin at the slits with a peak rather than a trough if the barrier is at an angle? In the case of a proper wave, it's because they branch from the same wave and so of course have to be in-phase. With multi-heads, this isn't gauranteed? Well, for a ripple it wouldn't be either, also depending on the angle to the slits/barrier, so I guess it's the same.

But maybe assuming this criterium of regular photon-quantity oscillation is reasonable to some extent as well, even for sunlight. 

That being said, the most likely answer is that photons are just excitations in this wave (quantum field) and are effectively [sampled as point-dots from throughout that wave in quantity-proportion to the energy contained in that wave.](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Quantum-sampling.md)
