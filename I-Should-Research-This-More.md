**Question:** How does the centripetal acceleration of the Earth's motion around the sun affect weight?

# Debate

### Shouldn’t centripetal force create a stronger sense of gravity on the sun-side of the Earth?

Yes, though also the sun’s gravity would be slightly higher.

But overall, this seems like an under-appreciated fact about the distribution of perceived gravity and perhaps can be sensed by the body as more than just day and night.

It’s amazing in 2024 it’s unknown how much of the balance is centripetal vs. sun’s gravity, but I imagine sun’s gravity is pretty small and I imagine people would’ve measured the mass difference if the centripetal effect wasn’t also pretty small.

Still, that’s basic gravity, and just because it’s unmeasurable doesn’t mean it’s not true/fundamental. 

#

Shouldn’t the Earth’s angular acceleration create a bigger centripetal force than it does?

#

It’s funny, centrifugal force, like along the equator, due to Earth’s rotation, is a well known phenomenon that changes sensed gravity https://www.quora.com/Does-the-Earths-rotation-create-centrifugal-force-against-everything-on-its-surface-If-so-does-that-mean-we-arent-experiencing-gravity-as-strong-as-it-should-be

Why aren’t we considering Earth’s angular acceleration? That, fundamentally, is centripetal force. 

This actually sort of answers it. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/qed9rx/comment/hhs96qh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button </br>
But clearly it’s not a well known/understood/appreciated phenomenon in physics.

But then this makes a counterpoint: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration
“Gravitation therefore does not cause proper acceleration, because the same gravity acts equally on the inertial observer.“</br>
And yet centripetal force exists, so this can’t be right…?</br>
The gravity from the sun is the same, and the inertial velocity of human is the same. (Same as for the Earth). - in the case of gravity</br>
Whereas in centripetal force, the angular (inward) acceleration of the observer is detached from the angular (inward) acceleration of the “gravity simulator”, so the gravity-unaffected human only has the inertial velocity, but not the inward pull. So that creates an extra (“simulated”) gravity sensation. - in the case of centripetal force</br>
The two are not equivalent.

Okay, resolution^. Question answered. No.

### No. See above. (Maybe. See below)

Gravity ties a tether to both revolver (Earth) and observer (human).

But what if the human was hanging on the tether in the centripetal force example?

Answer 1: They would still feel the “simulated gravity”.

- So what’s special about gravity, and in particular the Earth’s revolution around the sun, that prevents the sensation of “extra gravity” (centripetal force)?

Answer 2: They would no longer feel the “simulated gravity” towards the other revolving mass.

- Then okay.

In good faith, I’ll assume Answer 2.

And yet…

I’m not sure.

I think if I hung onto that tether I’d still be drawn towards the edge of the spinning contraption. Why? Because my velocity pulls that way, and velocity is inertial; acceleration isn’t.

### Therefore, I conclude physicists are dumb. There’s some extra mass during daytime hours.

- It *might* be offset by sun’s gravity.

#

Ah, and yet, I got one thing backwards. Without the human being also attached to the tether, the human would feel no force. So how do gravity simulators work?

Perhaps by centrifugal force. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gravity
- See the “Balls in a rotating spacecraft” GIF.

It looks in fact to be by centripetal acceleration. 

So why would humans not feel this on Earth? 

Let’s construct an artificial gravity simulator via a tennis ball being spun around on a string, and miniature humans hang onto that string together with the tennis ball. The human would be centripetally (like “gravitationally”) pulled towards the tennis ball, unless they held on really tight.

But humans don’t hold on really tight to gravity? Oh wait, they do. Humans experience the same gravity. They’re attached by the hip. They literally can’t separate from that tether any more than the Earth can.
- So then that’s the answer.

### Back to no. See above.

But, that still doesn’t account for the centripetal pull that happens regardless.

Even if the miniature human were to hang on that string with all of their strength and barely move, they’d still feel a huge energy towards the tennis ball. It takes force to resist the centripetal action.

So even attached at the hip to that string, the miniature human would still experience an artificial gravity.

### I re-conclude that physicists are dumb. But it’s tricky, and there’s some extra mass during daytime hours.

- The human's momentum is also much smaller in the velocity direction than the Earth's (due to the lighter mass), meaning, if not for the Earth's gravity, the human would probably be sucked in by the sun (pulled in by the violent tether). The Earth meanwhile has a perfect balance of resistance due to its mass and velocity to keep a stable orbit. In other words, that centripital action is quite heavily offset by the sun's gravity due to a human's much smaller momentum, with only the Earth serving as the centripital and gravitational actor and the sun violently pulling inwards.

Ah, so the tether is the Earth. That centripital force is the gravitational force.

Then no, there is not an extra fictional-mass due to centripital action.

### Back to no.

Hmm, not quite. It's actually sort of complicated.

The angular acceleration of the Earth should cause some small force on the human, independent from the gravitational force.

However, the human's angular acceleration towards the sun is technically even heavier than the Earth's because of the lighter momentum, yet the human is tethered against it by the Earth's gravity.

That angular acceleration in that case depends on distance from the sun, so there would still be a perceived-mass difference between day hours and night hours. (Maybe really small and hard to measure).

#

**The Earth's gravity and the sun's gravity balance out to pin the human comfortably on the Earth. After that, the Earth's angular acceleration adds some extra pressure to the human's feet.**

And yes, that means slightly (perhaps below measurement precision levels) more perceived gravity at daytime than nighttime. 

### Yes. There’s some extra gravity-like force during daytime hours.

**Short answer:** The Earth's gravity and the sun's gravity balance out to pin the human comfortably on the Earth. After that, the Earth's angular acceleration adds some extra pressure to the sun-facing human's feet.

And yes, that means slightly (perhaps below measurement precision levels) more perceived gravity at daytime than nighttime.

Yes. There’s some extra gravity-like force during daytime hours.

Why? Because velocity is inertial; acceleration isn’t. Only the Earth is angularly accelerating, due to the sun's gravity, while the human in the Earth's gravitational field is not accelerating independent from the Earth (and the force from the pulling sun is almost completely negated by the Earth's gravitational field). 

Can derive this later. Just start with Earth and sun's gravities, add Earth's acceleration, and show it exceeds human's acceleration $\rightarrow$ therefore extra weight. "Why don't we feel it?" Because [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/qed9rx/comment/hhs96qh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
- Suppose a human is standing on the equator at noon. Consider acceleration in the Sun direction for both the Earth and the human. The Earth's acceleration towards the Sun is $X$ amount such that its inertial velocity is captured in a stable orbital motion (exactly the Sun's gravity). The human's acceleration in the Sun's direction is negative, since the Earth's gravitational field pulls/stabilizes the human towards the Earth. Therefore the Earth's acceleration towards the Sun exceeds the human's acceleration towards the Sun, and therefore the human experiences an extra weight due to the Earth's angular acceleration. This angular acceleration is really small, veritabily $5e^{-3} \frac{m}{s^2}$, imperceptible to a human, but it means that teh human's weight is greater due to the Earth's motion.
- This might seem confusing since the human also has an inertial velocity that corresponds with the Earth's inertial velocity tangent to the Earth's orbit. The human however doesn't have an "inertial angular acceleration" since such a thing doesn't exist.

But angular velocity is distinct from angular acceleration, isn't it? Is the Earth's angular velocity inertial? Is the human's? If so, then the answer goes back to no. But the human's angular velocity around the Sun can't be inertial because the human has no angular velocity independent from the pressure of the Earth. If the ground of the Earth suddenly became ephemeral (a hole appeared), the human wouldn't keep along the same angular trajectory, but would, rather, fall through. 

However, the Earth's sun-directed acceleration is just the Sun's gravity, which should be perceptible to a human if it weren't cancelled out in the Earth direction by Earth's gravity. However, there is a portion of it in the angular direction not cancelled out.

- Suppose a human is standing on the equator at noon. Consider acceleration in the Sun direction for both the Earth and the human. The Earth's acceleration towards the Sun is $X$ amount such that its inertial velocity is captured in a stable orbital motion (exactly the Sun's gravity). This motion becomes its "angular velocity". The human's acceleration in the Sun's direction is negative ($Y < 0$), since the Earth's gravitational field pulls/stabilizes the human towards the Earth. $Y$ accounts for both the Sun's and Earth's forces on the human. The Sun's component is also $X$ on the human since all masses are accelerated by the same gravitational source the same, and the human shares the Earth's inertial velocity tangent to the motion of orbit, so the human and Earth are in one inertial angular orbit.
  - But if the Earth disapeared, the human wouldn't keep along its "inertial velocity". The human would fall into the Sun. The inertial velocity of the human is due to the human being attached to the Earth via the Earth's gravity, which is not a velocity inducing force. In other words, that gravity doesn't pull the human towards that inertial frame, just locks the human into it. And then the Earth revolves around the Sun at an angle due to the Sun's gravity, but it has already accounted for the Sun's gravity on the part of the human. Therefore the human experiences an additional force.
 
The Sun exerts a gravitational acceleration on the human only once, and the Earth's gravity accounts for it. However, the Sun also exerts a gravitational acceleration on the Earth, inducing the angular trajectory. That extra sun-directed acceleration is not accounted for, and so the human's weight is affected by the relative direction of that acceleration.

That acceleration is the Sun's gravitational acceleration but minus the Earth's momentum acceleration-resistance in the orbit's tangent direction. That's an imperceptibly small, but physically real, amount ($5.9e^{-3} \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$). What is that sun-directed component of acceleration called? It's distinct from "angular acceleration". It's called centripetal acceleration.

Since the Earth's gravity negates the Sun's gravitational effect on the human, the human's inertial linear velocity isn't complemented with an angular velocity (and there's no such thing as inertial angular velocity, despite the misleading use of the word "velocity"), except that which is provided by the Earth's push and pull. During daytime that push is stronger, and during nighttime that push is non-existent and only gravity keeps you tethered as the Earth moves away at an angle towards the Sun.

### Yes. There’s some extra gravity-like force during daytime hours.

Counter point: "But on the nighttime side, the Sun's gravity is added to the Earth's gravity, not "cancelled out". Combined with inertial linear velocity, that suffices to lock the human into the same orbital motion as the Earth, independent of the Earth's gravity. 

The issue is, the Sun's gravity isn't cancelled out, during any hours. So the Earth's centripetal acceleration is the same as the human's and weight remains the same."

In other words, the Earth's gravity locks the human into an inertial linear velocity, and the Sun's centripetal acceleration ends up the same for the human as the Earth.

The Sun's gravitational pull on the human is the same as on the Earth. And the human's inertial linear velocity is the same as the Earth's. So no extra relative centripetal effect.

### No.

However, the human's linear inertia is much weaker than the Earth's (lower mass means weaker inertia). So the Sun's gravitational acceleration actually affects the human more than it does the Earth. And so the centripetal acceleration perhaps does turn out to be different... 

While all masses fall at the same rate, they don't all change inertial linear velocities at the same rate.

So the human is actually falling towards the Sun faster. Meaning, the Sun-directed acceleration is greater than the Earth's from the Sun's gravity. Meanwhile, linear velocity is the same as the Earth's. So centripetal acceleration must be different between the human and the Earth. Then there is a weight change...

There are three accelerations to consider. (1) The centripetal acceleration of the Earth around the Sun (due to the Earth's inertial linear velocity and the Sun's gravitational acceleration), (2) the centripetal acceleration of the human around the Sun (due to the human's inertial linear velocity and the Sun's gravitational acceleration), and (3) the gravitational acceleration of the human towards the Earth. If (1) and (2) are not equal, then there is an extra unaccounted for acceleration on the human experienced on the Earth besides the Earth's gravity, like a kind of centripetal wind. 

And (1) and (2) can't be equal since the Sun's gravitational acceleration is the same for both the human and the Earth, but the inertial linear velocities have different inertias (different masses) for both the human and the Earth, meaning the Sun's gravitational acceleration is faster on the one with less inertia (less mass) (the human).

So the Earth's gravity is sort of pulling the human along as the human experiences a stronger weight... at night rather than day?

TODO: Compute centripetal force of just Earth, then of just human, and the gravitational force of just human with respect to just Earth. Those are all forces present. 

Well, here are all accelerations present for the human and the Earth:

1. Centripetal acceleration of just the Earth around just the Sun.
2. Gravitational acceleration of just the human towards just the Sun.
3. Gravitational acceleration of just the human towards just the Earth.
4. Gravitational acceleration of just the Earth towards just the human. (negligible)

If 1 $\neq$ 2, then the centripetal acceleration of the Earth $\neq$ the centripetal acceleration of the human, then a centripetal wind exists!

And 1 $\neq$ 2 since the Earth accelerates towards the Sun much slower than the human does due to its greater inertia (higher mass).

TODO: Compute these values and figure out the value of the centripetal wind.

That net acceleration is experienced in the direction of the Sun by every body on Earth. But how is that distinct from just the Sun's gravity if there was no net acceleration? I guess the effect is like a fictitious strengthening of the Sun's gravity. ~~No...~~

My inertial linear velocity requires a pull from gravity because the Sun's centripetal acceleration works faster on me than it does for the Earth. That's because my mass is less than that of the Earth, and so my inertia in my linear velocity is weaker, and I am more heavily pulled into the Sun than the Earth. But the Earth's gravity offsets or adds to my faster-curving linear velocity, depending on whether it's daytime or nighttime. So depending how "glued" the body is to the Earth, the stronger this fictitious augmentation to the Sun's gravity? Or depending on the size of the cross section taken? The smaller the sub-mass, the stronger this fictitious augmentation. Then the entire Earth weighs in slightly onto the daytime hemisphere from the nighttime hemisphere.

But if every sub-mass experiences this effect equally, how would we ever know? Well, some regions, like the Earth itself, are denser than others. So the less "glued", free hanging regions, A.K.A. bodies on the surface, experience this effect more noticably the less their mass.

Less massive bodies are more drawn towards the Sun due to a net higher centripetal acceleration compared to the Earth, though their security in the Earth's gravitational field would also be stronger, so mass might not be a factor. The net centripetal acceleration towards the Sun is a factor.

### No. Acceleration is the same for small masses as large masses. Even without the Earth, a human with the same inertial velocity and distance from the sun would still maintain the same orbit as the Earth due to the same gravitational (centripetal) acceleration. Orbital stability doesn't depend on mass.

If miraculously the sun got lighter or heavier, then that would be a centripetal... "jerk" I guess it would be called, and that would result in an angular acceleration as well, though *perhaps* a loss of meaning of tangential/inertial velocity as the body goes into freefall into the sun due to a positive centripetal jerk or escapes orbit due to negative centripetal jerk (in both cases, converting to linear velocity, and perhaps changing value, e.g., increasing the closer it gets to the sun as it accelerates more), though in both cases the angular velocity might just be converted directly to linear velocity of the same value as the original tangential/inertial velocity (though in the freefall case, this is hard to imagine unless that conversion finishes at exactly the moment of the crash) — this opens a new debate, the unresolved question of how the resulting linear velocity relates to the original tangential velocity, after centripetal jerk. But that's an altogether different consideration.

Oh, I think it's simpler than this. During orbit, the linear velocity can stay constant. Once a centripetal jerk disrupts the orbit, the linear velocity, which is the same as "tangential" or "inertial", no longer accelerates/decelerates with respect to direction only, but starts actually giving or absorbing some magnitude, depending on whether escaping orbit or crashing. For example, if the body is escaping orbit, it gives less in terms of direction, but more in terms of magnitude, thereby increasing in radius from the sun but decreasing in the inertial velocity, until it either re-stabilizes at a different orbit (if the directional/centripetal acceleration sufficiently captures it) or escapes.

There's also debate among experts more generally ([e.g. this was a possibly-wrong but helpful answer](https://qr.ae/pscaUB)) about whether DC conduction through a solenoid (a coil of wire) can cause EM radiation. That circular motion requires at least some centripetal acceleration and therefore (under existing understandings of charges as emitting photons due to accelerations, including centripetal) should emit photons, and [some experts have the jargon to credibly assert that](https://qr.ae/pscaJd) (["synchrotron radiation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron_radiation)) while the general populace, including the experts, often (at least evidenced by Quora answers that don't use the words "synchrotron radiation") regard non-fluctuating DC conduction as not emitting EM radiation (besides potentially from heat), even when conducting through a solenoid rather than a straight wire. But if that were true, then Rutherford's model of atomic orbitals would be valid against the existing critiques of Rutherford's model that argue that the orbitting electrons of his model would emit photons (EM radiation) due to the centripetal acceleration and thereby "crash into the nucleus" (or more generally, lose stability in their orbits). So, since conduction through a circular coil necessitates some centripetal acceleration, the critique of Rutherford's atomic model is upper bounded by the validity of whether DC current through a solenoid emits EM radiation. That might come as a surprise to some electrical engineers, since Rutherford's atomic model is (considered) obsolete primarily due to that critique (and de Broglie's nice unification of Bohr's version of Rutherford's model with wave theory). In practice, the EM radiation from those circular paths of DC I guess is negligible enough that electrical engineers don't acknowledge it, whereas with AC, the EM radiation is sufficiently non-negligible that it's widely accepted. However, if the photons emitted are so negligible with DC, and we know that photon energies are quantized, is it not possible that in an atomic orbital like the one Rutherford proposed and Bohr elaborated on, even without de Broglie's wave generalization, that the photons emitted due to those orbits is / would be negligible, especially given that any energy packets of photons emitted would have to be quantized with an action potential limitting the actual expulsion of any photons if the centripetal acceleration remained below that action potential? (In other words, Rutherford's model might not be as ruled out as physicists think exactly).

Since electrons in Bohr's model move at less than $1$% the speed of light around the atom, and since "synchrotron radiation" happens at relativistic speeds (meaning, near the speed of light), the evidence from synchrotrons doesn't really apply. But non-relativistic ["cyclotrons"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron_radiation#:~:text=Cyclotron%20radiation%20is%20emitted%20by,information%20about%20distant%20magnetic%20fields.) still emit photons, though I'm not sure if the electrons are ever measured emitting photons at below $1$% the speed of light.

[I am still awaiting an answer on this.](https://qr.ae/pscSsZ)

I'm also pretty bothered by the lack of distinction between centripetal acceleration due to attraction (like with gravity) and centripetal acceleration due to repulsion (like with artifical gravity, as in, ["it is the radial force provided by the spacecraft's hull that acts as centripetal force"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gravity), due to the centrifugal acceleration towards that hull), but I guess this is good since I can derive a better model for the universe's physics by taking these intuitions of mine seriously instead of thinking there are experts who know better. Besides the gravity examples, electrons in atoms revolve by centripetal-attractions, while electrons in those accelerators perhaps revolve via magnetic centripetal-repulsions.

Some other distinctions to think about: Radial motion is like a wheel changing size, axial motion is like a hypothetical velocity orthogonal to the wheel (e.g., imagine a warrier battering somebody with a shield with a wheel as its crest), and the Azimuthal (or circumferential) motion is like the wheel spinning (the warrior starts juggling the shield horizontally I guess). The motion where velocity is in the direction parallel to the wheel (e.g., with cars, wheelbarrows, trains, and what I visualized as [“wristwatch probabilities”](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Magic-Smartwatch-Probabilities.md)) is radial, but there is not exactly a word for the rotation along the different parallel planes possible to such a radial motion (what I referred to as [polarity](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Magic-Smartwatch-Probabilities.md), but maybe can be imagined as the warrior juggling the shield vertically, and called "axial rotation"). Interestingly, parallelism with respect to the wheel (that is, radial, as opposed to orthogonality, that is, axial motion) allows for an additional axis of motion (“axial rotation”) while remaining true to its definition. Technically then, the [wristwatch](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Magic-Smartwatch-Probabilities.md)’s velocity is a radial motion, its minute-hand is circumferential, and there’s still no word for the “axial rotation” of the wristwatch that I’m aware of. Meanwhile, curvilinear motion is just angular velocity, and curvilinear acceleration is angular acceleration (not centripetal). Meanwhile, circumferential is a category of curvilinear. I think I've just outlined a good ontology, though the definitions of axial motion that I've found seem to be contradicting (<a href="https://www.vaia.com/en-us/explanations/engineering/solid-mechanics/curvilinear-motion#va-main-content-block bg-ui-white px-12 py-16 p-md-24 p-lg-32 my-24 my-md-40 my-2xl-54 rounded-8 rounded-md-12 rounded-2xl-16">here</a> and [here](https://qr.ae/psSpwo) vs. [here](https://qr.ae/psSpwo) and [here](https://qr.ae/psSpwu)). Since the former definitions of axial motion distinguish themselves from circumferential/curvilinear/angular/rotary/etc, I think they're probably better, and consistent with the "axial rotation" I referred to that there might not be a standardized term for (unless mine shall do).

# Resolution

It doesn't.

Gravitational acceleration is [the same for small masses as large masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_experiment). Even without the Earth, a human with the same inertial velocity and distance from the sun would still maintain the same orbit as the Earth due to the same gravitational (centripetal) acceleration and inertial (tangential) velocity. Inertial (tangential) velocity is fixed once the human is at the Earth's speed. It's only during an acceleration, e.g. an angular acceleration (distinct from centripetal) due to linear (tangential) acceleration, that weight is affected (or, if miraculously the sun got lighter or heavier, then centripetal... [jerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics)) I guess it would be called, and that would result in an angular acceleration as well, as well as eventually a linear/tangential one). Orbital stability doesn't depend on the orbiting body's mass.
