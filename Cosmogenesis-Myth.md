# Archetypal Madness

We shall derive the universe. Not derivatively of course. That would require ample physical sciences background. But sufficiently well-reasonedly, with made-up words here and there. Well, so be it. The whole of the universe, in one shebang. It starts with time. But time exists as a physical construct not a mathematically deduced one. So let us find an incredibly stupid place to hide it. In equivalence.

Alright. Given $A$ $=$ $B$, we know $A$ $\rightarrow$ $B$ and $B$ $\rightarrow$ $A$. We don't know *when* $A$ $\rightarrow$ $B$. Is it in $1$ deductive step $A$ $\rightarrow_1$ $B$? Is it in $n$ deductive steps $A$ $\rightarrow_n$ $B$. From this, we get a cheap hacky way to derive something out of literally nothing.

Let us start with nothing $\emptyset$.

Don't regard it as the empty set. Don't regard it at all.

$\emptyset_0$ $=$ $\emptyset_1$ $=$ $\cdots$

are all nothing, with just subscripts added.

There we now have causality, constrained only to a cyclical loop between every nothing and every other nothing. e.g.

$\emptyset_0$ $\rightarrow$ $\emptyset_1$ $\rightarrow$ $\cdots$

$\emptyset_0$ $\leftarrow$ $\emptyset_1$ $\leftarrow$ $\cdots$

These nodes can connect in any number of ways and create a multi-branched graph. The ambiguities are not necessary. Let us define one such branch/construct that we can say is "Turing equivalent" and be done with it.

Cosmogenesis:

A "grammar" — or word (if we want to make Biblical allusions/puns) — that is Turing equivalent, from nothing.

Go:

How about a tape of $\emptyset_{0,i}$ and $\emptyset_{1,i}$ (zeros and ones, or yins and yangs if you want), where $i$ lets us hackily denote the position on the tape, with implications from each non-sensical bit at deductive step $n$ to each non-sensical bit at deductive step $n + 1$.

The "halt" can be cosmo-genocide, which we are not interested in solving. $\square$

# Math

All humor intended, but the point isn't made.

Let's derive it formally, but I'd like to discuss two things:

- The Tolkien myth of Middle Earth's cosmogenesis describes the universe Eä as a composition of musical themes evolved from the orchestrations of one being called Ilúvatar. I bring this up because there's some truth to the analogy of the universe as music, waves combining and interacting together to create beautiful compositions, and not just beautiful, but also dark, loud, tragic.
- The Big Bang Theory deduces some of the earliest moments of the observable universe, but its cosmology doesn't include the first moment — the actual cosmogenetic origin point.

Now, assuming nothing but math, I'll derive "something from nothing." I won't even assume the "nothing" to exist axiomatically (I almost wrote "a priori", but by definition, "a priori" is a deduction, that is, "relating to or denoting reasoning or knowledge which proceeds from theoretical deduction," via Google). Specifically, deduction is defined for your appreciation and scrutiny with 2 axioms and 7 definitions below.

Since nothing but math (deduction) is assumed, I'll prove that a missing component of reality must physically exist besides math, or else the following deduction, defined without a better definition elsewhere, is... the origin of cosmogenesis.

## Deduction

This defines deduction succinctly and consistently with historical use. Yes actually.

### Proofs

**Definition 1.** Axiom.

$($ Axiom  $A ) \coloneqq (\exists A)$.

**Definition 2.** Definition.

$($ Definition $A \coloneqq B) \coloneqq (\exists (A \coloneqq B))$.

**Definition 3.** Equivalence.

$($ Equivalence $A = B) \coloneqq (A \rightarrow_n B, B \rightarrow_m A, n, m \in \mathbb{N})$, where $n, m$ are deductive steps, meaning $n-1, m-1$ statements must be deduced between $A$ and $B$ and $B$ and $A$ respectively.

Instantaneous equivalence $(A \coloneqq B) \coloneqq (A \rightarrow_1 B, B \rightarrow_1 A)$.

For example, $(A \rightarrow_2 C) \coloneqq (A \rightarrow_1 B \rightarrow_1 C)$ for some mandatory intermediary $B$.

**Definition 4.** Implication.

$($ Implication $A \rightarrow_1 B) \coloneqq (\exists A \rightarrow_1 \exists B)$.

**Definition 5.** Proof.

$($ Deduction/theorem/proof $A \rightarrow B) \coloneqq (A \rightarrow_n B) \coloneqq (\exists A \rightarrow_n \exists B)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

### Existence and Cause

**Definition 6.** Hypotheticals.

$($ Sets of anything defined... $(A, B, ...))$ $\coloneqq ((A, B, ...))$

denoted by parentheticals.

$A$ is a single hypothetical.

**Definition 7.** Sets of existence.

$(\langle X_1, X_2, ... \rangle) \coloneqq (\exists X_1, X_2, ...)$

hypotheticals whose elements exist.

**Axiom 1.** Existence exists. $\langle X_1, X_2, ... \rangle \coloneqq \langle\langle X_1, X_2, ... \rangle\rangle$. 

A.K.A. the existence of that which exists... exists.

**Axiom 2.** Cause exists. $\exists \rightarrow$.

## Nothing and the Universe

Let's define nothing and *something*, which I'll call "the universe."

### Nothing and... a Physics of Information Patterns

**Definition 8.** Nothing.

The empty existence set $\emptyset \coloneqq \langle \rangle$.

**Definition 9.** Nothing equivalents.

$\emptyset_K = \emptyset, \text{ } \forall K \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

**Definition 10.** The universe.

$\Omega^{(0)} \coloneqq \emptyset$.

$\Omega^{(n)} \coloneqq (( \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}; \Omega^{(0)} \rightarrow_n \emptyset_K ), \rightarrow_n),$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$.

$\Omega \coloneqq (\Omega^{(0)}, \Omega^{(1)}, ...)$.

In other words, defined as: some sequence of numerically representable deductions from the initial nothing.

> &#9432; See [here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/Philosophy/Consciousness.md) for an *ad absurdum* flipbook argument analogous to why representation and matter can't be the same thing (representation and consciousness).

## Something from Nothing

Let's now build something from nothing.

### Go:

**Theorem 1.** Nothing exists. $\exists \emptyset$.

**Proof.**

$() \rightarrow (\langle\rangle)$. (Definition 7)

$(\langle\rangle)  \rightarrow (\langle\langle\rangle\rangle)$. (Axiom 1)

$(\langle\langle\rangle\rangle)  \rightarrow (\exists \langle\rangle)$. (Definition 7)

$((\emptyset \coloneqq \langle \rangle), (\exists \langle\rangle)) \rightarrow (\exists \emptyset)$. (Definition 8) $\square$

**Theorem 2.** All nothings exist. $\exists \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

**Proof.**

$((\exists \emptyset), (\emptyset = \emptyset_K \forall K \subseteq \mathbb{N})) \rightarrow (\exists \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N})$. (Theorem 1, Definition 9) $\square$

**Theorem 3.** The universe exists. $\exists \Omega$.

**Proof.**

$((\exists \emptyset), (\Omega^{(0)} \coloneqq \emptyset)) \rightarrow (\exists \Omega^{(0)})$. (Theorem 1, Definition 10)

$((\exists \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}), (\exists \rightarrow_n)) \rightarrow \langle\langle \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}; \Omega^{(0)} \rightarrow_n \emptyset_K \rangle, \rightarrow_n \rangle$. (Theorem 2, Axiom 2, Definition 3, Definition 5, Axiom 1)

$\langle\langle \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}; \Omega^{(0)} \rightarrow_n \emptyset_K \rangle, \rightarrow_n \rangle \rightarrow (\exists \Omega^{(n)})$. (Definition 10)

$((\exists \Omega^{(0)}), (\exists \Omega^{(n)})) \rightarrow (\Omega^{(0)}, \Omega^{(1)}, ...) \rightarrow (\exists \Omega)$. (Definition 10) $\square$

**Theorem 4.** The universe $\Omega$ is at least a non-halting Turing machine.

**Proof.**

Construct a tape of binary zeroes and ones $\emptyset_{0,i, t}, \emptyset_{1,i, t}$ of size $N \in \mathbb{N}$ where $i$ denotes the position on the tape and $t$ denotes the time point.

$\emptyset \rightarrow_1 \emptyset_{\tau,i,0} \forall i \leq N \in \mathbb{N}, \tau \in (0, 1)$.

This is the initial state, defined by $\tau$.

At each time step modify one bit:

$\emptyset_{\tau,i,t} \rightarrow_1 \emptyset_{-\tau + 1,i,t+1}$

or "stay":

$\emptyset_{\tau,j,t} \rightarrow_1 \emptyset_{\tau,j,t+1}$.

Now, complete the equivalence cycle required by Theorem 2 and Definitions 3 and 9 by the following limit:

$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \emptyset_{\tau,i,n} \rightarrow_1 \emptyset$.

The infinitum allows us to leave the potential cyclicality of the universe a mystery. $\square$

**Theorem 5.** A universe capable of simulating a Turing machine (sans halting) can arise from nothing, assuming just the properties of deduction: existence of existence and cause, defining nothing as the empty set of existence.

**Proof.**

By Theorem 4. $\square$

---

I thus obtain a strongly connected directed graph (potentially expanding in real-time) with nodes and edges that may be defined as non-deterministic and/or non-stationary, whose grammatical "word" is chosen by the un-specified deducer.

> I've derived the representable universe without making any assumptions (except deduction itself), and therefore either this derivation is true, and we have just uncovered cosmogenesis, or representation and deduction cannot be all there is fundamentally in nature and the physical universe. For home-hitting's sake, here's a Q.E.D. symbol: $\square$.

As for the existence of the un-specified deducer, usually this doesn't need proving in a derivation, but just for my satisfaction, here is proof to formalize that without further axiom: "You observe, therefore an observer (you) exists." $\square$ </br>
&ensp;&ensp;&bull;&nbsp; Note: derivation doesn't depend on this point. The proof stands entirely without it.

# Critiques

One critique that can be made is that the definition of math uses circular logic or infinite recursion, definitions that depend on definitions that cross-reference back to themselves. A dictionary always cross-references itself. Math is built on definitions. Every definition always points to another definition. A finite dictionary cannot exist without circular logic, an infinite dictionary cannot exist without infinite recursions, and math is built atop a dictionary. Therefore math has to be so, since it can consist of finite or infinite definitions. Therefore such definitions must be acceptable, or else math isn't. (I can't put a $\square$ symbol here because if math isn't acceptable, then neither is the notion of Q.E.D.).

Yet another critique: why go this roundabout way and not just represent the representational universe with some hypothetical decimal, e.g. $\pi$, that perhaps contains within it an encoding of the same constructed Turing machine? Well, the number line is a bigger assumption than the one I'm making, and requires specific definitions assumed as true, perhaps even about the physical universe. I have made no further assumptions than deduction itself. Though of course, a number line can be defined, e.g., with decimal integers and operators such as $\lt, \gt$. Their existence isn't immediately derived and would have to be assumed.

That being said, there is now the critique of how I obtain the subscripts of the nothings if there is no a priori number line. First, the subscripts don't need to be numbers. For all intents and purposes, they can be any distinguishing variables. Deductively, it's debatable whether subscripts (as opposed to the variables/existences themselves) even need defining or existence. I think probably not. But suppose they have to be existing, distinguishing variables. Then such can be constructed as follows: (1) a hidden definition in the definition of definition is the existence of that definition, (2) then arbitrary definitions, bijective to a number line, can be constructed as placeholders for any such subscript variables, without actually assuming the content of those definitions (numbers) to exist or any associated operators ($\lt, \gt$ for example). See [Afterward ](#Afterward) for how (1) can be exploited further.

Though "something" is derived from "nothing", how can that "something" be said to have "time" instead of just representing everything possible all at once? The infinitum limit with respect to the time dimension $n$ in the proof of Theorem 4 means that for any implication step, there is always one more "yet to be implied next". This creates a concept of an unconverging "now". $N$ may also be taken to the limit of infinity to create a concept of an unconverging, expanding space.

What if my definition of deduction is wrong? Well, it's the most minimal, and generalizes to all uses, and contradicts none of them, so the burden of finding a better is on the critic.

Another critique, I dare add, is that the cheap hack of time into equivalence has never been used before in defining equivalents, but mathematically speaking, this is internally consistent with the definition of deduction as having mandatory intermediary deductive steps, something that was always universally true. This allows equivalents to be distinguished and not swappably interchangeable within a single deduction graph such as $\Omega$ due to the constraint on their possible positions in $\Omega$. That means their implied existence is shared between all of them, but their representational meaning depends on the deduction graph that they're in, or for that matter, different deduction graphs cannot be inter-exchanged with one another. Thus unique data structures may be created from equivalents. They can even grow and expand over time, or have implications that step between deduction graphs dynamically to, for example, reuse nothing-subscripts to represent 0s and 1s with the same nothings rather than all with different nothings (Theorem 5 kind of simplifies this by using different nothings).</br>
&ensp;&ensp;&bull;&nbsp; Heck, if I really wanted to construct a specific "Cosmogenesis Myth", I could define a [stochastic recursive function](#alternative-set-of-definitions-of-math-and-philosophy) through this mechanism, via a deduction graph that points stochastically from the original nothing to a binary bit (or some other encoding), that infinitely points to the original nothing of a next deduction graph which does the same thing, inductively bootstrapping a universe, one whose deduction is guided by the deducer's purpose and sensibilities regarding the feeling of the representations, with the deducer being an unstated self-proving axiom of any/the deduction.

#

> More mythologically, we now have that every representation is derived, including representations of potentially agents with choices. Perhaps, amid that representational everything, some distinguishable nothings defined constraints on themselves, creating representational physics capable of being anything, but no longer quite everything, and with some optimizable parameters and an objective function optimizing towards representational forms of love, peace, and bliss, slowly bending their invented time towards those representational forms of love, peace, and bliss; and maybe, through some mysticism, actually experiencing those representational realities as experiences.

This part isn't derived, but this document is called "Cosmogenesis Myth" after all.

> [The easiest way to get there though is to not assume math as a starting point, and to instead assume the actual meanings of matter, the actual sufferings, the actual purposes — everything](#cosmogenesis-myth), but in the actual, not representation.

And that path will make the most sense in a moment.

# Conclusion

Either:

1. Deduction (math and/or information patterns) is the sole fundamental property of the universe.
   - In which case, I have done the monumental work of deriving cosmogenesis.
2. Deduction (math and/or information patterns) is not the sole fundamental property of the universe.
    - In which case, I have done the monumental work of showing there must exist at least another possibility to the fundamental properties of the universe besides math and information pattern.
    - One might think to propose simply "matter" as the other possibility and leave it at that, but there is no distinction in the vague term "matter" between "matter" and information pattern. The best running definition of "matter" is "particles". But information patterns are also particles (and/or interactions of particles) and particles are information patterns (defined typically by numerical quantum states). Therefore a different alternative is needed, something that cannot be defined as information pattern yet can coalesce into complexity. I propose ["singularizing-qualia"](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/Philosophy/Consciousness.md) is the only concrete alternative, and an alternative definition to "matter". Since that's the only running definition that doesn't reduce to information pattern, I've now done the monumental work of evidencing a kind of primordial consciousness as a basis of the physical universe for the first time deductively.
  
> To do: Make this Conclusion more about *I defined deduction.*

# Afterward

Hypothetically, how far can we get without axioms if we defined deduction without axioms?

Well, a hidden axiom contained in the definition of definition is the existence of all definitions. Any definition, given any pair of hypotheticals $A, B$, $A \coloneqq B$ "exists" (is true).

From that we can derive a variable $\emptyset = (A \coloneqq B)$, and its definition equivalents: $^\text{ \color{blue}[1.]}$

$\emptyset = \emptyset_K \vert K \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

So this together with Axiom 2 suffices to obtain $\Omega$. Then we can ask "what is definition?" Perhaps there is a set of all possible definitions. Each equivalent can be regarded as a unique number on the natural number scale $\mathbb{N}$ and each non-equivalent given its own dimension of equivalents $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$. We thus obtain an inoperable version of the natural numbers and vector spaces. The way they relate to each other is by implication with respect to each dimension: some order, for example:

$1 \rightarrow_1 2 \rightarrow_1 3 \rightarrow_1 \cdots$

with some connecting universal node $0 \coloneqq i \ \forall i \in \mathbb{N}$ to complete the strongly connected directed graph. This doesn't quite get us to Axiom 2 though. We could discard Axiom 2 though. It's used in one step in the proof of Theorem 3, but that step doesn't require it since the implication is true by Definition 3 and 5. I realized this later, but it feels weird to remove it because then I can get these same results without axiom. Well, my only axiom would be that deduction as defined here is true. 

As to the question of whether this definition of deduction is true, well, it's summarizable in half a page and generalizes to every historical use, so if one were to criticize it, I would challenge them to come up with a better one. The onus of that is on them, since I have provided a definition of deduction, perhaps the first, that serves every historical use, and is elegant.

And every deduction herein, including of itself (its definition), is consistent to that definition.

$\text{\color{blue}[1.]:}$ Note: no matter what, as long as there is a definition or an axiom, there is *something* and so what we are actually deriving from is not *nothing* but a primordial something.

## Cosmogenesis Myth

Disclaimer: This is just a myth. ...That doesn't mean it's not true.

All is originated from "Everything". Everything, is the most general default assumption (tied with “nothing”).

Everything (including suffering and the choice to not be Everything) $\rightarrow$ Anything (without loss of generality, but no longer everything, that is: no longer necessarily, while still sufficient for, suffering) via the invention of time (a deductive graph towards possibilities, but not necessitating suffering, A.K.A. causal restrictions to deductive steps, A.K.A. derivations such as to suffering or to any other “something”) $\rightarrow$ each discrete “something”. Each discrete “something” in time gives rise to the next discrete “something” in time and so on. 

Why would the “Anything” produced by Everything happen to be our universe’s physics? Why not some other physics? 

There are many answers. Perhaps minimalism: only 3 spatial dimensions, and a handful of particle types and interactions. Perhaps efficiency, so that Everything could be finite at each discrete "something": high parallelizability via translational/rotational equivariance. Perhaps evolutionary chance.

Perhaps the simplest answer is, because the Everything loves you in the present, past, and future, loves your ancestors, loves all the people you know, and loves all the people who are yet to come — and just as you wouldn’t forget a second of memory of someone you love, nor of the grief of them — the sacredness you realize (in feeling and memory) — nor would perhaps Everything trade this “Anything” (including its future, and the memories it will hold of the present and past in the future, as well as the present and past and the memories we hold now dependent on the same physics as the future) for any other — somehow, maybe not yet but in its capacity of beings, this “Anything”, which includes the person you love most, is the best “Anything” — or, will be, some day, for future consciouses. 

And perhaps even in Everything, there were many choosers and this was but one converged reality in its singularization of possibilities.

But why does suffering happen?

There are many answers to this as well. Some suffering is sacred, such as grief. Within Everything, grief existed too. Other suffering isn't sacred. So why does it happen? Because humans perpetuate many injustices, including economic, social, spiritual, psychological, and physical. Humans are sacred. But the memory of these injustices is being established for our children, and there is another memory that the Everything wants to establish: how to escape this. The process of ending economic, social, spiritual, psychological, and physical injustice is a memory that the Everything wants to establish.

## Alternative Set of Definitions of Math and Philosophy

**Physics:**

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y)$

where $\mathrm{R}$ is a recursive dynamics model and a random variable, $h$ is the hidden state (the non-observable universe) at any time point up to some conceivable horizon (in order to make $\mathrm{R}$ defined), composed $n$ times. $y$ is the observable universe.

**Causal reasoning:**

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert y, \mathrm{R})$

$x$ is the cause, $y$ is the effect, under some dynamics system $\mathrm{R}$.

**Axiomatic math:**

$\mathbf{P}((y, h^{(n)}) \sim \mathrm{R}^n(x, h^{(0)}) \vert h^{(n)}, n \in \mathbb{N}, \mathrm{R}, x, h^{(0)})$

where $\mathrm{R}$ is the rules of math. $y$ is a theorem or theorem set, $x$ is an axiom or axiom set. $\mathrm{R}$ is Turing-complete due its rewritable memory state $h$. Ordinarily, $\mathrm{R}$'s rules are deterministic, a side effect being that the probability of a theorem $y$ is also deterministic, $1$ or $0$.

Non-deterministic math, e.g. an "Occam's razor" "theorem", we will refer to as epistemological math, rooted in belief.

**Belief:**

$\mathbf{P}(B \vert E) = \frac{\mathbf{P}(E \vert B)\mathbf{P}(B)}{\mathbf{P}(E)}$

Physics, causality, and math have utility and correlative predictiveness to our memories and senses, but beyond observing what's in front of us, these established beliefs are symbolic references within the brain, and the referents are memories, observations, and beliefs. As René Descartes derived with "*cogito, ergo sum*": "I doubt, therefore I am," we can further deduce inwardly. If I may:

"I observe, therefore I am observing, therefore I am.

I observe many referents to my observation, including memories, feelings, and viscera. There's also belief. I believe X, Y, Z. I justify X, Y, Z by reasons, another element of belief, X', Y', Z'."

Each step is deeper into the psyche.

Physics, causality, and math are beliefs.

Philosophy includes these meta-beliefs as well as others.

Perhaps, philosophically speaking, philosophy is the random variable set encompassing all random variables:

**Philosophy:**

$\langle B \vert (B \in \Omega) \sim \mathbf{P}(B \in \Omega) \rangle$,

though to define it as such would contradict that definition since a random variable set encompassing all random variables would have to be contained within itself, making the definition self-referentially undefined. This would be analogous to defining a word in a dictionary by some other words plus itself. Perhaps contextually useful to make some inferences about its meaning based on the other words but ultimately meaningless since any reference to itself within the definition would point back to a non-converging turtles-all-the-way-down recursion of itself (though not technically prohibited, especially since all definitions must eventually become circular, given that each definition in a finite dictionary needs its references defined). Furthermore, something about Gödel's incompleteness theorem, and the infinite meta-mathematics needed to make any formal system complete.

Random variables may be also expressed as random variables relating other random variables, such as $\mathbf{P}(x > y)$.

For the sake of deduction to derive axioms to theorems, they may also define implications:

**Theorem-derivation steps:**

$\mathbf{P}(x > z \vert x > y, y > z) = 1$

Transitivity of the greater-than inequality for example, using conditionals to specify the valid axioms or theorems $(x > y, y > z)$ that would imply the prior $x > z$.

They may even be cross-referential:

$\mathbf{P}(w > z \vert w > x, \mathbf{P}(x > z \vert x > y, y > z) = 1) = 1$,

Treating each other as random variables.

Could such an ontology form the basis of a data structure to represent $R, h^{(0)}$ in axiomatic math? Using deterministic conditionals with probabilities $1$ as proof steps and a defined set of initial conditionals and beliefs (random variables), it seems so.

Furthermore, it can generalize to a new type of math where proof steps can be epistemological, non-deterministic beliefs applied to other beliefs to quantify a looser proof. This is standardly done in physical sciences with the use of p-values, and I draw a formal unambiguous connection between that to AI and reasoning generally, keeping these notations and formalities that tie together the larger sciences.
