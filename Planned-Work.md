1. A Unified Wave Theory of Light and General Relativity
    - Multi-slit diffraction
    - EM emission from accelerated charges
    - Polarization and velocity-adaptive polarization persistence
    - Doppler shift
    - Allegiances
    - Hydrogen atom
    - Maybe inner velocity - save for 3
2. Conclusive Disproof of Lorentz Transformation
    - In Short
    - Formally
    - Errors in Einstein’s Derivation
    - Other Little Disproofs
    - Speed of Light Constant as Attributed Reason for Special and General Theories Disproof 
    - Easiest-Alternative for Special and General Theories for Experimental Agreement
    - Alternatives to Speed of Light Constant
    - A Unified Theory of Everything - might be overkill
    - “Unifying with Wave theory”
    - Maybe velocity addition formula standalone disproof
3. The Universe as Behavior of Bodies on a Bendy 4D Space-Ball
    - Time dilation
    - Length contraction
    - Fizeau experiment
    - Schwarzschild derivation, Mercury perihelion advance and light deflection simulation maybe, red shift simulation maybe (kind of important to discredit universe expansion and possibly dark matter, cosmological constant, and heat death)
        - Red shift might be easy, too, if assuming approximately uniform density of matter such that the accelerative bias oscillates between directions, on average keeping the light beam on a straight path, but also decreasing its frequency by an accelerating amount with distance traveled (since each tug accelerates, so the red shift is quadratic with respect to distance), with that directionally oscillating on-average-uniform bias being analogous to the cosmological constant, but thereby explaining away properties of the universe like dark matter, expansion, and inevitable heat death — total destruction of the universe and all inhabitants — cosmogenocide — which is Good News.   
    - Model with principled code. 
    - Maybe conclude with the first general relativistic double-slit experiment model. 

These three papers can perhaps all reference each other. 

1. Mythology of Dark and Light
    - Electron repulsion 
    - Stern-Gerlach experiment 
    - Polarization filter
    - Baryonic asymmetry 
    - Annihilation - to do
    - Protons
    - Neutrons 
2. Mythology of Threads
    - Wave behavior of molecules
    - Measurement problem - sampled particle’s allegiance (meanwhile, jerk minimization works on all heads, not just sampled one) and probabilities persist 
    - Quantum-erasure experiments 
    - Consciousness theory

Possible Chapters for a A Unified Wave Theory

- Equation that governs all physics
- Spacetime
- Curves/bends in spacetime 
- Dynamics
- Relativistic Wave Packets
- Probability Wave Function
- Velocities
- Sampled Velocities 
- Relativistic Multi-Headed Wave Packets (RMHWP)
    - What makes them relativistic? Doppler shift?

Can point out that can be put on any spacetime one likes, and even show round ball-universe as example, to conclude general relativity unification.
- Or use length contraction and derive Schwarzschild as example, e.g., for example, here is relativistic Doppler effect, or here is perceptual distance contraction in the axis of motion, as examples of special relativistic spacetimes, and here is a derivation of Schwarzschild to give us general relativistic behavior. And we can even put this on a bendy spacetime, e.g., the surface of a 4D hypersphere, with no loss of generality to being added to any other spacetime.
- Or save all concrete examples except Doppler shift for Bendy Ball paper. Suffices to point out that can be put on any spacetime one likes.
    - Can get rid of “K” and point out that these point particles can be regarded in any way larger bodies or masses can, meaning, they can be put on the same spacetimes or given the same relativistic effects. Then as for sampling, can define a universal sampling frame for each particle, since interference happens due to intersection and intersection isn’t relative, but also sampling can just be always with respect to the particle’s own reference frame, and how those samples look in other reference frames can be determined via whatever relativistic transformations one is using.

Unknown things like the intensities emitted w.r.t. charge acceleration or exact electric and magnetic force (polarity size, A.K.A., “steel”), can be hyperparameters w.l.o.g.. Then only need to keep track of polarity orientations persistently. And provide my 2nd proof in “What is Light?” 1st proof can also be added somewhere. Maybe in 4D Space-Ball paper when deriving conservation laws. But also here maybe just due to relevance.  Unless inner velocity and wavelets defined here, then that become relevant, but now there’d be a contentious new gravity theory, so maybe inner velocity and frequency changes shouldn’t be mentioned here, aside from maybe how relativistic time dilation could be added to change the frequencies, e.g., red shift. Phase unification and jerk minimization to do Hydrogen atom. Allegiance for Doppler shift. And that should be all.
