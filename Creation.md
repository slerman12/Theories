Here I'll explain how cosmogenesis happened.

There's a big question, of how something could've arisen from nothing.

The question itself assumes nothing as the initial state. That's the most reasonable initial state because it's the most general.

Oh wait, psych. It's not the most general. Well, it is, but it's tied with "everything."

So suppose that at the initial state there was just everything, everywhere, all at once. Yes, like that movie title. So all the suffering and all the glory and joy.

Step 1: Not feel extreme suffering. Everything includes the ability to converge into something else. What better to converge to than "anything"? Anything is distinct from everything. It's the possibility for everything that everything has, but no longer everywhere, all at once. Therefore we have time, the present moment, and a future that can, hypothetically, be anything that everything was without loss of generality. But now the suffering doesn't have to be so bad. However, this self-limitation is limiting and means the computation power goes down. Infinite computation power would mean going back to "everything" again and we don't want that because too much suffering. So everything becomes anything. Everything $\rightarrow$ anything.

1D, 2D, 3D are all necessary for something like humans to exist. Anything just isn't computationally efficient if everything's represented on a 1D number line. In 3D, we can have both locality and therefore potentially infinite parallelizations of the same computation, and all the complexity of anything, potentially, with time. 3D is the minimal number of dimensions to have all the benefits of locality, efficiency, and rich complexity of anything.

But then why of all the somethings for "anything" to be right now, is it this something? Why not utopia?

Well, it's a bit like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. You don't want to forget your grief, even if you think you do. Some pain is too sacred. If you had the choice, would you forget your grandparents because you miss them? Would you sell away the pain? Neither would God. So he crafted a universe that's imperfect, at least from our 3D perspectives, but in 4D, across time, *e.g.*, billions of years, maybe everything makes sense. Maybe all the pain today makes the reality a billion years from now more meaningful or something. But, what you're really asking is why these laws of physics instead of some other laws of physics. Well, if it were some other laws of physics, your mom wouldn't exist. So maybe God just really loves your mom.

Oh, and "nothing" as the initial state makes no sense. There would have to be some function that transforms nothing into something. So you're really assuming "nothing" and some function. Since that function doesn't belong to the empty set (unless you define the empty set in some really unusual functional form), that assumption is contradictory. And if you're already defining your own nothing-functions, that's less general than both "nothing" and "everything" and therefore defeats the logical advantage of assuming "nothing".

Meanwhile, physics just plainly assumes elementary particles and fundamental forces. That's really specific.

Is God limited? In 3D, yes, but the arc of time can bend towards anything. The universe is 4D and so, no, taking time into account, God's unlimited. "Heat death" is bologna because cyclicalities, expansion, and sufficiently separated regions can always prevent total entropic collapse, or something.

So you can throw a ball in the air and call the universe weak if it it doesn't leave the exosphere, but given enough time, the universe could probably get that ball or an identical one onto a rocket ship and propel it wherever.

Why not have infinite computation power AND time? Well, maybe at that initial state of everything there were competing forces, since everything includes everything. Maybe not all of everything wanted this anything, and there were different ideas what's good and what's bad. So maybe, whatever the flux converged to was the first chance it had to be anything other than the extreme misery it was in as everything, and it took that chance and became this anything, somewhat randomly, because this anything was "good enough".

Everything $\rightarrow$ good enough anything $\rightarrow$ this something $\rightarrow$ ongoing to new somethings towards the best of anything and everything, according to whatever the goal converged to / or is converging to.
