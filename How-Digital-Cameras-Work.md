# How Digital Cameras Work

Photodiodes are cool. They work by using the "conduct-ability" (conductiveness?) of electrons in excited states (since those electrons are less strongly held to the nucleus due to being further away).

Then when light excites the atoms, I guess some anode-cathode pair (diode) called a photodiode accentuates the tendency for those excited electrons to escape orbit, and they end up creating electrical current as a result. I think the diode effectively creates a charge gradient basically, thereby accentuating that conduction.

Same as film, photodiodes rely on the light's absorption by electrons, not antennas. I guess absorbent conductive elements like silicon or germanium can be used.

Color filters can be used to filter which colors get through to excite said atoms/electrons.

The different voltages (from the conducting electrons) for red, green, and blue spectrum-biasing color filters can be digitally interpolated to digitally infer what color of light arrived at that pixel, same as photopsins in our eyes. Each pixel corresponds to a location on the image.
