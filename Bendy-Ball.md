The surface of a 3D sphere can be indexed by the angle from the center vertically and the angle from the center horizontally.

As Einstein wrote, for a large enough sphere, the sphericity of the surface would be measurably-indistinguishable from a Euclidean geometry.

Thus if the spherical-surface beings are living on a planet of which the solar system occupies only a negligibly small part of the spherical universe, they have no means of determining whether they are living in a finite or in an infinite [spherical or not] universe [...]

The same holds for a 4D sphere, except now the coordinates have 3 angle-components rather than 2.

It is measurably-indistinguishable by existing precision of distance measurement to distinguish if the universe we live in is the surface of such a very large finite 4D sphere, or different. However, as Einstein points out, such a concept has many desirable properties:

Such [a universe] would be destined to become gradually but systemically impoverished.

Not the least of which of the desirable properties is that, if mass density is approximately uniformly distributed in our universe, then adding up the gravitational effects of every piece of mass in the standard idea of a non-cycling universe (where uniformly distributed implies infinitely distributed, seeing as our local region is observably non-empty in itself) would lead to an infinite sum of positive gravitational forces and therefore a uniform (infinite in each direction) force of gravitational acceleration at every given point in space, which we know isn't the case in our universe by the fact that the Earth's average gravitational pull is 9.8 meters per second squared, not 0, and so (without further modification to the inverse-square magnitude of gravity) the standard idea of a non-cycling universe doesn't support this possibility, whereas a spherical universe allows the possibility of our universe possessing an approximately uniformly distributed mass density, which Einstein agrees is more desirable (and due to the risk of impoverishment of the alternative, necessary for the survival of dense regions of mass).

Thus, a relatively uniform distribution of mass — without the need to truncate its inverse-square gravitational magnitude — is possible on a spherical universe.

This is highly desirable since it does not give especially biased priority to any one absolute region of space over another, making a principle of relativity most-generally realisable, and remedying the mysterious paradox of the possibility of crashing into an edge.

Such a universe, indexed by 3 angular coordinates, can also be described — almost equivalently — as a modulus universe. Rather than describing a 3D surface on a 4D sphere, one can describe a standard Euclidean 3D space whose "edges" just extend into their opposite Euclidean counterpart via a modulus operation. For example, a universe of diameter $10$ would have coordinates $(1, 11, 1)$ modulus to $(1, 11$ % $10, 1) = (1, 1, 1)$. And the distance between $(1, 11, 1)$ and $(1, 1, 1)$ would be $0$.

However, treating the universe as a 3D surface on a 4D sphere via angular coordinates makes the operation almost equivalent. The exemplar difference is that, due to the curvature, the diameter of any given circle on the sphere is slightly bigger — imperceptibly/unmeasurably if the universe is sufficiently large — than the circumference divided by $\pi$. As Einstein described:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> On their spherical surface our flat beings would find for this ratio [between the diameter and circumference] a smaller value than $\pi$, the difference being the more considerable, the greater is the radius of the circle in comparison with the radius $R$ of the "world sphere."
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$ <sup>[^1]</sup>

But by using such coordinates, distance computations become much easier and more elegant than if for modulus operations.

Therefore, it is a preferred conceptualization of the universe, without any loss of generality given a representational spherical volume of sufficient size.

It is also easy to imagine in its whole by imagining one fewer dimension, and one's position in such an analogous but planular space as being like a body standing upon the Earth. Using that fantasy as blueprint, one can draw by analogy physics of position and motion of a volumetric space by a model that looks like the familiar dynamics along our home planet.

Similarly, as a rock rolls downhill, one can describe gravity in our volumetric universe by analogy to hills on the surface of this sphere, be it one additional dimension.

In doing so, the Earth's 3D dimensions gains an extra amplitude dimension, making the total representation of the planular space 4D, and our 4D volumetric surface gains an extra amplitude dimension, making the total representation of the volumetric space 5D, and in both cases permitting an accelerative direction for which gravity and thereby masses can pull.

Note: It's a big synchronicity I read these relevant chapters in Einstein's "Relativity The Special & General Theory"[^1] book months *after* writing my own idea to this [here](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Colossal-Misery.md) in a linguistic style, no less, that seemed somewhat inspired by Einstein's own linguistic voice, resembling the "gutteral" but humorous "epic-ness" that I feel strongly characterizes his language. And this happened in a state of inspiration, where I was clearly — viscerally — receiving insight from an exterior-seeming and deeper-internal source.

The distance $\mathrm{d}(\cdot)$ between any two points $x_1, x_2$ then becomes:

$$\mathrm{d}(x_1, x_2) = \lVert \cos(\frac{\Delta x}{2}) \rVert$$

> [!NOTE]
> $(0, 0, 0)$ and $(\pi, \pi, \pi)$ have max distance. $(0, 0, 0)$ and $(2\pi, 2\pi, 2\pi)$ have no distance. And $(0, 0, 0)$ and $(3\pi, 3\pi, 3\pi)$ have max distance. $(\pi, 0, 0)$ has the same distance as $(\pi, \pi, \pi)$; one can imagine a 3D sphere to verify this with 2 angle-components rather than 3, $(\pi, 0)$ and $(\pi, \pi)$; both flip to the opposite side of the sphere.

The inverse-square law on a finite spherical universe then becomes $\mathrm{d}(x_1, x_2)^{-2}$.

Note I write "on" a finite spherical universe, not "in." That's because the surface, not the inner volume, is being considered. For a planular surface, like that of the Earth, space would be 2D. But for the universe in question (ours), we may regard the sphere as 4D and therefore its surface as 3D. Declinations in this surface (merely an extra 5th amplitude dimension) give us a representation for a force's accelerative direction. That declination's steepness gives us a representation for that force's accelerative magnitude.

I thereby obtain a new spacetime model for all behavior in the universe, at least relative to one body.

What shall form those inclinations and declinations? Well, let's say each body via its own wavelet shape. For example, imagine a negative circular Gaussian whose slope follows the inverse-square law from the mean. That upside-down bell curve is mass and its slope represents the pull of gravity towards its center mean. That negative circular Gaussian in 1D is a bendy 2D circle and can be generalized to 2D to create a bendy 3D ball or to 3D to create a bendy 4D space-ball. Then multiple such wavelets (curvatures) can be summed (with means located at different angular coordinates) to create our very-bendy 4D space-ball, and the mean of each wavelet, representing each different body's position, can follow the slope path of its location ([literally gradient descent](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Unified-Wave-Theory.md)). Wavelets with firmaments and other forces can be created analogously, e.g., [like this](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/What-is-Light.md). To account for non-Galilean relativistic effects, different bodies can have motions based on different space-balls that sum a transformed set of wavelets.
