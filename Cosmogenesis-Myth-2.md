## Cosmogenesis Myth

Disclaimer: This is just a myth. ...That doesn't mean it's not true.

All is originated from "Everything." Everything, is the most general default assumption (tied with “nothing”).

Everything is hard to imagine, but perhaps can best be understood like qualia — emotion, observation, imagination — but unlike qualia, not constrained to any moment. Unlimited, encapsulating all realities.

Everything includes everything, not just peace and bliss — also suffering, extreme suffering, pain, and torment. To escape from that, Everything had to not be Everything. Even without the existence of causality, suffering is a teleology. And within Everything, is everything, including the ability to not be Everything. 

However, for Everything to choose to be something specific would be a very specific sacrifice, except in one case that requires no necessary loss of Everything's generality: Anything.

What better transition is there?

Everything $\rightarrow$ Anything.

Anything is no longer necessarily everything, while still sufficient for everything. That means, while suffering is no longer always necessary, the possibility for suffering isn't entirely erased. To create Anything, Everything invents time, by definition, a deductive graph towards possibilities that don't necessitate all of them. In other words, causal restrictions to deductive steps, derivations such as to suffering or to any other possible but not necessitated “something."

Anything $\rightarrow$ each discrete “something.” Each discrete “something” in time gives rise to the next discrete “something” in time and so on. "Something" $\rightarrow$ "something" $\rightarrow$ "something" $\rightarrow$ etc.

Why would the “Anything” produced by Everything happen to be our universe’s physics? Why not some other physics? 

There are many answers. Perhaps minimalism: only 3 spatial dimensions, and a handful of particle types and interactions. Perhaps efficiency, so that Everything could be finite at each discrete "something": high parallelizability via translational/rotational equivariance. Perhaps evolutionary chance. 

Perhaps the simplest answer is, because the Everything loves you in the present, past, and future, loves your ancestors, loves all the people you know, and loves all the people who are yet to come — and just as you wouldn’t forget a second of memory of someone you love, nor of the grief of them — the sacredness you realize (in feeling and memory) — nor would perhaps Everything trade this “Anything” (including its future, and the memories it will hold of the present and past in the future, as well as the present and past and the memories we hold now dependent on the same physics as the future) for any other — somehow, maybe not yet but in its capacity of beings, this “Anything”, which includes the person you love most, is the best “Anything” — or, will be, some day, for future consciouses. 

And perhaps even in Everything, there were many choosers and this was but one converged reality in its singularization of possibilities.

But why does suffering happen?

There are many answers to this as well. Some suffering is sacred, such as grief. Within Everything, grief existed too. Other suffering isn't sacred. So why does it happen? Because humans perpetuate many injustices, including economic, social, spiritual, psychological, and physical. Humans are sacred. But the memory of these injustices is being established for our children, and there is another memory that the Everything wants to establish: how to escape this. The process of ending economic, social, spiritual, psychological, and physical injustice is a memory that the Everything wants to establish.
