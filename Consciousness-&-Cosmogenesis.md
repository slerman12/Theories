# Consciousness & Cosmogenesis

1. We're able to feel complex emotional experiences at the same time, and observe many concurrent phenomena, including, for example, the visual image before our eyes. This singular observation might be an illusion, or might be a literal singularization of phenomena into a single observer. The former can be said about anything and lacks an explanation. The latter agrees literally with observation, since we observe ourselves respectively as one observer. Since our observation — immediate observation, or observation of our memories, or observation of what others have taught — is the source of all scientific knowledge, it is a reasonable place to base scientific belief from.
2. My physics explanation for how this singularization might happen, elaborated on later in this work, is evidenced by a measured phenomenon in standard physics.
3. Singularization or no singularization, either way, there are many bodies, neurons, interacting in a brain. For bodies and interactions to produce consciousness might depend on specific matter and matter interactions, such as specifically those of the neural grey matter and voltages of the brain, or abstract representations and information patterns, such as just the neural firing patterns.
4. My flipbook thought experiment, elaborated on later in this work, reduces the latter possibility to absurdity.
5. Thus, the best explanation for consciousness remaining will be singularization (via my hypothesized physics theory, lacking any other), and specific physical matter and modes of interactions (via biological neurons and reactions), with the other possible explanations addressed and shown, by logical inference, logically implausible.
6. Then one more point is made about how assuming consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe leads to a new answer to the mystery of cosmogenesis. That answer is specified.
7. Finally, all of this together paints a strongly evidenced theory of consciousness, as well as cosmogenesis, whose alternatives have much less justification. 

## First possibility: the standard view

According to this first possibility, the brain's neural patterns sufficiently encode the complexity of consciousness experience, and from that information representation, which can take many forms — distributed, recurrent, centralized with respect to specific regions —  emerges the illusion of a singularized observer for which consciousness is interpreted.

In this view, consciousness is the many (neurons and all that compose the brain), not singularized into one, interacting as independent bodies within a circuit-type system that produces the observable experience of consciousness.

So under this framework, singular experience is an illusion, and actually the distributed neural encodings — their information patterns — suffice to create consciousness because of their representation of consciousness experience, and the singular experience is a described part of that representation, even though the neurons are themselves independent and separated in space, functioning over a non-local spatial distribution.

There doesn’t exist any notion of a singularizing force in the fields of physics or neurology. Instead, the commonly held view in agreement with the existing knowledge of those fields is that the encodings of the brain, via those patterns of activity, via the neurons firing, produce a sufficient representation for experience that we just interpret as consciousness, but it’s not literally a new singular "thing." It’s a bunch of many-things with specific information attributed to them, even though our observation of the many phenomena appears singular to us.

"And how could it be something else?" experts in those fields might ask. There isn’t a "singularizing magic force" that exists in standard physics that can take a bunch of disconnected matter and go, "okay, now all of you are singularized into one ‘thing’ that can be experienced singularly." Even stable atoms are composed of elementary particles. Nor is there any notion of that in neurology, even when certain brain regions are isolated as crucial to consciousness, because those regions are still composed of many independent neurons.

To summarize this possibility in one sentence: Consciousness is information patterns, in which the encodings themselves, such as those represented by the brain’s neurons, produce the illusion of a singularized experience and thereby consciousness.

This view also opens the room for representing such "life" in artificial neural networks for example, or other realistic simulations of the brain, solely by their representative capability, and connects to the longstanding question of whether computers, including GPUs running modern artificial neural networks, can be conscious, if representation really is what consciousness is.

## Second possibility: consciousness as the singularization of a many into one

Possibility 2. Consciousness is literally the singularization of the many into one — meaning, of a single observer, though potentially of multiple experience phenomena — not just as an illusion — as an actual singularization in physics. Somehow, all of those neurons become one "thing" that attributably exists besides just that distribution of disconnected matter.

To summarize this possibility: Consciousness is a kind of magic singularizing force that exists literally in physics — not really magic, but I’m calling it that because it exists beyond the knowledge of today's physics, neurology, etc. — and somehow singularizes, literally, the brain’s neurons, or certain regions of the brain where information becomes most centralized, such as the thalamus, so that different experiences can be observed singularly by a single observer. 

### Different from fire

Such a notion doesn't exist in chemistry either. Atom, molecule, or — take a single fire for example. Fire looks like a singular thing, a singular "lifeforce." Whether or not that's just a metaphor, measurement suggests a different picture. A fire is a reaction of oxidizing hydrocarbons splitting and spurting out electrons. Electrons are fermions that each exclude one another’s quantum states — they’re not singularized. The light from those accelerated or re-configured electrons can temporarily "singularize" — because the photons that make up light are bosons, not fermions — if singularizing means having the same quantum states. But even that’s distinct from the singularization of neurons in the brain, as hypothesized to explain singular experience, since those neurons don’t share quantum states and they exist in different, separated positions. They, like fermions (named after Enrico Fermi) and heavily including fermions in their composition, have firmaments — meaning, physical boundaries that would collide — and are non-local to each other. Molecules, and atoms, too, are composed of just fermions and bosons and their forces of interaction.

### Different from bosons

The intersection of boson quantum states depends on shared position wave functions.

Perhaps when the bosons intersect quantum states, they thread together some kind of singularization — however, this is not a standard concept and is an original concept, and isn't precisely/necessarily what I'm proposing.

The brain's communication is heavily facilitated by voltages, emitting bosons carrying the electromagnetic force throughout the brain, to such an extent that those signals can even be picked up in precise detail by EEGs even beyond the skull, even so much so with today’s artificial neural network-based decoders as to reverse engineer the approximate neural firing patterns, and, for example, operate like a telepathic remote control for a TV. And that technology works quite well today — even the reverse, of modulating neural activity via transcranial magnetic stimulation, affecting those same voltages, works, too — perhaps hypothetically even permitting sensitivity for some communication exchange at longer distances.

However, these technologies are communication exchanges via light patterns, which is more in line with possibility 1 than possibility 2. The notion of "threading" however, as in "they thread together some kind of singularization," is one I'll return to later with more of an argument, and one that's not dependent specifically on bosons but any matter generally.

## Absurdity of first possibility

Possibility 1 comes into a fallacy.

The following is as close to a disproof as one gets, an *ad absurdum* argument I came up with wherein the former view really does reduce to absurdity:

### Flipbook

Suppose every neuron and chemical messenger in your brain at time point  were drawn on the first page of a flipbook with pen. And then, on the second page, every neuron and chemical messenger in your brain at time point . And say these drawings proceeded for up to  time steps in arbitrarily precise detail. Heck, hypothesize the flipbook as the size of the moon if that helps the believability. And then you flip those paper pages, as a flipbook movie of all of your brain's neural processes plays forward. If information communication is all that human-like consciousness reduces to, then this book composed of mere parchment and ink, is human-like conscious. In fact, it's you-like conscious, experiencing your love, joy, grief, observations, and memories. All by the power of one's pen. If it were shrunk down to the size of a Bible, would you believe me that the book I hand you is not only alive, but when you flip its pages, it experiences everything you did 10 minutes ago? In all likelihood, you would find that dubious.

### Computer circuits (flipbook 2.0)

And likewise, we can extend the analogy to computer circuits, communicating information not on paper but on silicon chips, and not by pen ink but by electrons zipping through open-close logic gates. If the flipbook isn't human-like conscious, then how can this labyrinth of zipping electrons be (at least, without any kind of voltage-mediated singularization theory, and plausibly even then)? Even if those electrons zip through a moon-sized server of GPUs running the most advanced neural network or human brain simulation, their information communication is effectively just the flipping of the paper pages of a flipbook, and once again we obtain absurdity.

### Questions

So the question is, at what point does this information communication become a physical process that produces consciousness?

If the physical material didn't matter, we could simulate your consciousness with a domino chain. Or even with a human centipede/jamboree obeying the exact algorithm of your brain's dance of interactions.

Whether or not consciousness singularizes — and that does remain the most plausible explanation, or else how could the complex emotion represented by non-local physically separated matter with firmaments be observable by a single observer? — what this thought experiment shows, contra to which would truly be absurdity, is that consciousness does not arise simply from representation, and the physical matter, matters (or else paper and pen would suffice).

If representation doesn’t suffice, as that flipbook thought experiment shows it doesn’t, at least up to the point of absurdity, then the only other possibility is that there’s specific physical matter undergoing specific modes of interaction that produce consciousness. Simply paper and pen, or silicon chip and electrons, probably don't.

In any case, by the flipbook analogy, we've boiled down the credit for human consciousness to physical matter itself, not just its analogy of representations at the surface-level (whose flipbook-like representational sequences can't be, without absurdity, the source of consciousness). Now we have to ask: (1) where does the physicalness of consciousness begin, and (2) how, mechanically, does it entangle so as to be one consciousness?

## Physics of second possibility

Much like the word "fermion" synchronistically (meaning, possibly-coincidentally but still meaningfully) connects to the word "firmament," I’ll point out that "grey matter" — the matter that composes the brain — and "matter" more generally — matter (as in, they matter). The synchronicity of the word is that matter shouldn’t be regarded as just information or representation, but as being composed of something more that matters, whether the panpsychist notion of consciousness itself, or whether as inherently possessing some base, neutral qualia "elements" — the atomic/quantum units for qualia (emotion, feeling, observation) — or a singularization physics — a magic force in physics that threads together matter to make it matter, more. Or all of the above, where certain reactions correspond to certain qualia elements and are woven together by a singularization physics. In this notion, those entanglements then become the singularized experience of one’s consciousness, literally weaving within the universe’s physics one’s neurons wherein the individual non-local divisions — always forced apart by firmaments — are then harmonized into a single "one," literally, perhaps largely in specific centralizing regions of the brain like the thalamus, to create consciousness not as illusion but by such physics.

So the "grey matter" as it's called that composes your brain is not merely a representation machine, or an optional circuitry, but crucial to the singularization that is consciousness.

One might still argue that consciousness isn't a singularization. Sure, I've shown via reduction to absurdity, that consciousness depends on the physical material and modes of interaction. And sure, the idea of rich emotion somehow being felt by one observer at one time seems to depend on a "singular-ness." But what evidence is there in physics that such a singularization is possible?

I can provide one more unusually strong argument to that point (and then yet one more later in the next section). In physics, molecules undergo wave-particle duality much the same way elementary particles do, meaning in a double-slit diffraction experiment, where the detectors are kept off, molecules produce interference patterns on the projection screen in the same way as photons or electrons, as if they went through both slits at once like a wave. However, molecules, unlike elementary particles, are composites. Meaning, without some threading mechanism to interfere them respective to their whole, there's no reason why they wouldn't split in half or go through the slits in dispersed parts, and ultimately end up on the projection screen as independent atoms or elementary particles effectively ripped apart rather than arriving as a molecule, with a specific point dot on the projection screen showing where it landed. The way I hypothesize that's possible is through some threading mechanism in the universe's physics, that keeps the molecule coherent (even as it disperses through multiple slits at once), by which I also suspect is woven the singularization of consciousness I described here. 

The simplest answer is the panpsychist answer, that it begins from the elementary particles of the universe. And, more concretely as I propose, that it singularizes via a literal entanglement process that I call "threading," coherence states where the qualia of the divisible — base and perhaps neutral — singularizes into the complex, fires and dances of biological experience (or molecules). Somehow this conglomerate of interactions threads at the qualia level to produce more than just information communication, as what a paper flipbook could do by one's hand-drawings, or a domino machine, but singularized consciousness, capable of "feeling" those neural representational encodings.

### Reinforced by and reinforcing an answer to the mystery of cosmogenesis

Finally, there is the mystery why the universe has these qualia and entanglement ("threading") property and function.

And that is, rather than a mystery, quite an answer.

Cosmologists have asked for centuries, "How did something arise from nothing?" It's a good question. After all, it assumes the most general origin state: nothing. If it assumed something, as in, something specific, e.g. "God" or "the universe pretty much as it is," we'd have to ask, "Well, how did we get that extremely specific thing?" The most general assumption is the most reasonable default one.

However, there is another assumption tied to nothing in generality: and that's everything, including grief, bliss, misery, agony, and suffering. Infinite amounts of everything, all at once. Infinite joy and infinite peace and infinite pain.

Now, "nothing" succumbs to a pretty apparent fallacy. For something to arise from nothing, a function that transforms nothing into something must exist. But that function is in itself something, so our "nothing" assumption is contradicted as soon as any such function is introduced.

One might posit different origins besides "nothing" and "everything" equally general perhaps, such as cyclicality or infinite "turtles all the way down," but these are all specific somethings and cannot be said to be as general as the two mentioned, leaving the same mysteries, arguably no more general than assuming as default our own universe exactly as it is elementarily outright: "Where did the cycle come from?" or "Where did the infinite recursive turtle-stack come from?"

But assuming everything gives us a path forward. With this intrinsic qualia being ever present in the universe's foundations, the earlier reasoning can both be answered in its high-level and reinforced. How? By hypothesizing qualia — emotion, observation, imagination — at the root of the universe's nature, as well as the ability for that qualia to compose into orchestrations such as the singularized consciousness humans experience. Since those properties and function belong to “everything,” [we get a teleology for cosmogenesis](#cosmogenesis-myth) (see next chapter).

## Cosmogenesis Myth

Disclaimer: This is just a myth. ...That doesn't mean it's not true.

All is originated from "Everything." Everything, is the most general default assumption (tied with "nothing").

Everything is hard to imagine, but perhaps can best be understood like qualia — emotion, observation, imagination — but unlike qualia, not constrained to any moment. Unlimited, encapsulating all realities.

Everything includes everything, not just peace and bliss — also suffering, extreme suffering, pain, and torment. To escape from that, Everything had to not be Everything. Even without the existence of causality, suffering is a teleology. And within Everything, is everything, including the ability to not be Everything. 

However, for Everything to choose to be something specific would be a very specific sacrifice, except in one case that requires no necessary loss of Everything's generality: Anything.

What better transition is there?

Everything $\rightarrow$ Anything.

Anything is no longer necessarily everything, while still sufficient for everything. That means, while suffering is no longer always necessary, the possibility for suffering isn't entirely erased. To create Anything, Everything invents time, by definition, a deductive graph towards possibilities that don't necessitate all of them. In other words, causal restrictions to deductive steps, derivations such as to suffering or to any other possible but not necessitated "something."

Anything $\rightarrow$ each discrete "something." Each discrete "something" in time gives rise to the next discrete "something" in time and so on. "Something" $\rightarrow$ "something" $\rightarrow$ "something" $\rightarrow$ etc.

Why would the "Anything" produced by Everything happen to be our universe’s physics? Why not some other physics? 

There are many answers. Perhaps minimalism: only 3 spatial dimensions, and a handful of particle types and interactions. Perhaps efficiency, so that Everything could be finite at each discrete "something": high parallelizability via translational/rotational equivariance. Perhaps evolutionary chance. 

Perhaps the simplest answer is, because the Everything loves you in the present, past, and future, loves your ancestors, loves all the people you know, and loves all the people who are yet to come — and just as you wouldn’t forget a second of memory of someone you love, nor of the grief of them — the sacredness you realize (in feeling and memory) — nor would perhaps Everything trade this "Anything" (including its future, and the memories it will hold of the present and past in the future, as well as the present and past and the memories we hold now dependent on the same physics as the future) for any other — somehow, maybe not yet but in its capacity of beings, this "Anything", which includes the person you love most, is the best "Anything" — or, will be, some day, for future consciouses. 

And perhaps even in Everything, there were many choosers and this was but one converged reality in its singularization of possibilities.

But why does suffering happen?

There are many answers to this as well. Some suffering is sacred, such as grief. Within Everything, grief existed too. Other suffering isn't sacred. So why does it happen? Because humans perpetuate many injustices, including economic, social, spiritual, psychological, and physical. Humans are sacred. But the memory of these injustices is being established for our children, and there is another memory that the Everything wants to establish: how to escape this. The process of ending economic, social, spiritual, psychological, and physical injustice is a memory that the Everything wants to establish.
