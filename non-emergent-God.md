Altogether independent questions:

(a) _is there intelligence without us?_<br>
&ensp; or do our brains serve as the neural compute for the universe, <br>
&ensp; and how singularized do those distributed computations, <br>
&ensp; if that's what it is, get?

A.K.A. Is there a true God, or an emergent God, or an emergent something else?

_defining non-emergent God_:

——————<br>
God:<br>
——————

I think it's singularized and senses all of this and suffices to compute stuff (without a (emergent) biological brain)<br>
but it's essentially qualia with teleologies and the universe as body, able to change the feeling of that universe, but not the mind, maybe.<br>
the qualia, corresponding with that feeling, is sufficient to think and plan, somehow, and able to be represented, though I'm not sure if with-sufficient-conceptual-justice, by a neural network with an objective function. Where such a system came from to be able to think and feel, beyond the confines of matter and/or emergent biology, is unclear, or what it actually is as a non-representation to be able to exercise those functions perhaps not fully dependent to physical emergences e.g. biology.<br>
To disambiguate: singularized across the whole of the literal, cosmic universe. Thinking and feeling with no more than the tools of chaotic matter.

As for benevolent, good, or worshipable God, it depends on the teleology.
