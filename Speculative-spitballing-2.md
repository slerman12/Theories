# Time Dilation Is Sufficient For Length Contraction

Suppose 2 Galilean reference frames $K, K'$.

Galilean assumes Galilean relativity, however, not Galilean-consistent measurements, necessarily. We will elaborate in a moment.

$K'$ is traveling at velocity $v$ relative to $K$ at a uniform motion with respective time origins intersecting with respective space origins.

At any given distance of the origin of $K'$ from the origin of $K$, $x$, an observer at the origin of $K$ measures time $t$.

However, due to a time-measurement dilation, at that same distance of $x$, an observer at the origin of $K'$ measures time $t'$. The time-measurement dilation is defined as follows:

$$t' = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

I am not sure if this makes sense, but the velocity of $K'$ can no longer be attributed to the same measuring units as any on $K'$.

This means that for $K'$ to describe any velocity, including its own $v$, a measuring unit conversion is needed.

What is that measuring unit conversion?

Well, a single step in distance at velocity $v=1$ does not correspond to a single step in time.

For this to be resolved, without assuming length contraction, we must invent a new $v'$ whose length units, also invented, call them $x'$ and describe them as a different-length measuring rod, must be defined.

So this $x'$, somehow, must correspond 1 step in $t'$ with one step in $x'$.

And from that a velocity $v'$ can be defined (as $\frac{x'}{t'}$).[^1]

This now leads to $v' = \frac{x'}{t'}$ with an unknown $x'$, but a known $t'$.

We also know that $t'$ corresponds to $t$ by time dilation and $v'$ corresponds to $v$ somehow.

Since neither $v'$ nor $x'$ are defined, we may choose them arbitrarily for as long as $v' = \frac{x'}{t'}$. That being said, we will make a principled argument for $v' = v$.

$v'=v$ is the simplest choice (that, or $x'=x$). We have to choose at least one measuring unit paradigm, so one of these two, in any practical case, would be the most natural.

Let's see what happens with $v' = v$.

We get

$v = \frac{x}{t} = v' = \frac{x'}{t'}$

$\rightarrow \frac{x}{t} = \frac{x'}{t'}$

$\rightarrow x' = \frac{xt'}{t} = \frac{xt}{t\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

length contraction.

#

Now, if we assume $x' = x$:

$v = \frac{x}{t} = \frac{x'}{t}$,

and since $v' = \frac{x'}{t'}$,

we have

$x' = v't'$ and $v = \frac{v't'}{t}$

$\rightarrow v' = \frac{vt}{t'}$.

Combined with $v' = \frac{x'}{t'}$

$\rightarrow v' = \frac{vt}{t'} = \frac{x'}{t'} \rightarrow x' = vt \rightarrow \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial x'}{\partial t} = v$

leads to a contradiction since if $x' = x$ and $v' = v$, then $t' = t$, no time dilation.

this contradiction argument is false because $\frac{\partial x'}{\partial t} \neq v'$. Never mind on this point.

### Summary

**Q:** As time $t'$ increases, do clocks run faster or slower?

**A:** Faster </br>(more time passes)

**Q:** Therefore, if distance stays the same, how does velocity change?

**A:** It slows down.

**Q:** Now what if we allowed you to change the measuring units of distance so as to keep the velocity equal?

**A:** $v = \frac{x}{t} = \frac{x'}{t'} \rightarrow x' = \frac{xt'}{t} = \frac{xt}{t\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

We have now derived length contraction, by assuming length measuring units that make velocities equal across reference frames.

**Q:** Why choose $v = v'$ over $x = x'$?

**A:** Because it is easier to introduce a new $x'$ than a new $(\frac{\partial x}{\partial t'})'$.

**Argument:** Why not $v' =$ "something totally arbitrary"?

**A:** The burden of justification is totally on you. You would have to match $x'$ to justify it.

And, beware, that choice might contradict itself, ~~much like shown with the second most natural choice, $x' = x$~~.

However, since measuring units are ours to choose (and only ours), why and how would we choose something arbitrary when we have a (tied) proven simplest?

**Argument:** Yes, but we have Fahrenheit instead of Celsius for example. It can happen.

**A:** Up to you, if you can find another $x', v'$ pair that satisfies all assumed equations, e.g. $x' = \frac{v't}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ for any arbitrary $v'$. This would of course create an unnecessary level of complexity.

**Argument:** $x = x', v = \frac{v't'}{t}$.

**Tentative Answer:** Yes, but the principle of relativity (the principle in every variation of special relativity, including ones that don't assume constancy of light), says that reference frame $K'$ perceives $K$ as moving at the velocity, $-v$. So equating $v = v'$ seems more consistent with that. 

**Argument:** That is false, in tandem with time dilation, without a very convenient measuring unit conversion, something not assumed.

**We have just disproven the compatibility of special relativity with the principle of relativity, or at least that assumption that $K'$ measures the motion of $K$ as $-v$, if we believe both the reality of time dilation and length contraction as more than measurement-unit error.**

**A:** Weren't there Galilean assumptions made earlier? Maybe that's why.

**Arg:** They weren't used.

This... actually downgrades the existence of either time dilation or length contraction from theory to syllogism, by the way.

**A:** What if we say both time dilation and length contraction are true?

**Arg:** I mean, the measuring unit conversion isn't optional. Then you'd end up with an even weirder equivalence, and conforming it to $v$ and $-v$ mutual perspectives would contradict the fact that, that would be the case with no measuring-unit conversion. So, yeah.[^2]

[^1]: Assuming these variables all initialize at the origin, which is commonly assumed, but perhaps technically can't be since that requires synchronization of clocks between all observers at the origin. That's why this speculation is just speculation, but the math was useful for organizing my thoughts and might be useful in future derivations.
[^2]: Eh, not quite. The measuring unit conversion necessity cancels out I think in the presence of both time dilation and length contraction.
