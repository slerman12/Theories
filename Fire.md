The idea of saying "everything is one" is counterintuitive to most people.

It’s like saying "fire is water."

Therefore, below we will more or less prove that fire is water. Fire, actually, is water.

For fun. Let’s begin.

Fire is a result of compounds breaking in such a way that their fragments bond with oxygen in the air and their rupture releases an accelerating electron hailstorm of <!--accelerative electrons and--> photons, shooting into the air like knives, triggering a chain reaction of more such compounds breaking up.

Those compounds are called hydrocarbons, in the case of, for example, wood. Wood is hydrocarbons. Hydrogen and carbon. Paired together in holy divorcable matrimony.

Now when you rub them together hard and long enough with enough friction, you can rupture those bonds! After all, they’re held together quite precariously by gravity and electromagnetism and all of that. Squeeze ‘em hard enough and they more-or-less split.

So you rub two sticks together, say, using the [bow-drill method](https://youtu.be/_tpBCflcekU?si=XjzJAv3v1z3UOYJF) for fire making, and you rupture those hydrocarbons into hydrogens and carbons. Now the hydrogen will bond with the oxygen that is in the air (if you’re lucky), and the carbon will bond with the oxygen that is in the air  (if you’re unlucky), and this all-around combo-reconfiguration-of-bonding<sup>TM</sup> tends to leave excess energy that shoots off like knives into your eyes (or rather specific colors of light emitted by those accelerated/reconfigured electrons) — and also potentially into other atoms and hydrocarbons. So now that emission is what you see. It’s a spark!

If enough hydrocarbons are hanging around, say you put the ember in some tinder, now those little hailstorms will trigger a chain reaction. Like knives, they’ll cut through the other hydrocarbons present, creating instability — and more shooting photons and accelerating/re-configuring electrons. 

Meanwhile, those broken off hydrogens bonded to oxygen — you know what they are? Water! Water vapor technically. Steam, if you like, with its composition of oxygen and hydrogen amidst a hailstorm of photons and electrons. That "electricity water" is fire. 

Now the carbons on the other hand can also bond with oxygen. And that creates CO2. Meanwhile, some non-combustible elements in the mix (since non-charcoal wood for example is composed combustibly of more than just hydrocarbons) create the resultant ash and, its rising form, lifted by those gasses and water rising, smoke. 

(But does that mean fire is also CO2? Depending on the composition, maybe, though [more recently](https://www.osha.gov/green-jobs/hydrogen/fire-explosion#:~:text=Hydrogen%20used%20in%20the%20fuel,a%20leak%20can%20be%20detected.) [not necessarily](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-burn-something-without-producing-CO2) and [varies](https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-if-steam-contains-water-what-does-smoke-from-fire-contain-172505))

"Electriquey steam with some residue" — FIRE — in 5 words.

So fire is water? Yes, reconfigured-electron (let's call it "electriquey") water (electrons accelerating the way they do into water atoms). It is possible. It’s water with some electrons creating a photoelectric rainbow of red and blue and yellow in your survival-expert-tool-wielding human eyes.

If water with a neutron added is called ["heavy water,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water) why isn't gaseous water with some reconfiguring electrons (the excess energy of which causes light to be emitted) a kind of water, with ([or possibly without](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-burn-something-without-producing-CO2)) CO2 in the mix?<!--[^5]-->

Unlike fission, fusion<!-- (the sun's fire, undergoing fusion rather than combustion, is quite often heavy water)-->, and unrenewable energy sources, **"fire" in the primitive sense of our ancestor-paleolithic days in nature, is, vaporized regular H20, with no-neutrons, water (enchanted) by the power of electrons. With residue and sustainable levels of CO2 that the trees can breathe.**

That's, often, fire!

That reconfiguring swarm of electrons keeps the reaction going. It's why it feels hot and why the hydrogens and oxygens are energized to bond in the first place, where for example ordinary atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen might not, or for that matter water. Water at room temperature is pretty good at shutting those electrons down. So is CO2 for that matter. 

<!--
That’s fire! Or maybe the whole sum is fire, and "heavy water" should be renamed something else and only something else.

Disclaimer: this is meant to be educational comedy.

It still reads like tragedy.

If the fire is hot enough, as in magnesium fires, then you need something really dry, that isn't water or CO2, like copper, to separate the reactants from the oxygen frenzying it. In that case, water, vis a vis its supply of hydrogen and oxygen, can break apart and <!--actually--> fuel the magnesium with more <!--that stolen--> oxygen. 

Those work by igniting the magnesium with some other heat source, and the magnesium molecules breaking apart the way hydrocarbon molecules would, bonding with oxygen, and releasing a hailstorm of energy in the same way as that primal fire would.

Though in fires so hot like that, water need not come into the picture and we're just dealing with magnesium and all of the pollution needed to get it burning to such a hot degree. Unless, for example, that temperature were reached by the energy of the sun, whose hydrogens "fuse" into helium, or by the rupture of the atom e.g. uranium or plutonium as in the controlled atomic bomb power of nuclear fission, combined sometimes with fusion as in the hydrogen bomb, or man-induced fusion: via the use of deuterium-oxide ("heavy water"). That is, water with one extra neutron, whose, and I say this with caution, knife-cut can act a bit like electron energy in causing some disarray, if misused — that, a far deviation from the innocent days of nature.[^3]

> "Well, there are other kinds of fires, e.g., magnesium fires, that don't need water at all."<!--[^6]-->

<!--"Fire is usually water." Especially in the majority of human existence and in particular on Earth.-->

But here's an argument for why the definition of fire should be narrowed down to the primal one and those other fires should be called combustion: The definition is already narrowed down from fission, which like the shooting knives of fire, breaks apart neighbors through chain reactions facilitated by neutrons rather than photons, and from the acceleration of nuclei rather than electrons. If modifying water with a neutron doesn't change the "heavy water" from being water, then modifying photons with neutrons, and electrons with nuclei might not change "fission" from being fire. But it does. So we can narrow down that definition further in such a way as to respect primal ancestors, while still appreciating magnesium combustion, manufactured combustion, industrial combustion as combustion, **to remember the sacredness of our roots as a species, and the first technology we ever invented and evolved with**. Millions of years with one type of fire, and you want to equate it to magnesium? [Even candle wax is a hydrocarbon](https://candles.org/candle-science/#:~:text=All%20waxes%20are%20essentially%20hydrocarbons,the%20wick%20by%20capillary%20action.).

Yes, but the Garden of Eden wants its fire back.

> "Yes, and I'm Saruman, building my Urak-hai army with 'false' fires," Webster dictionary says snobbishly, thinking it's being sarcastic.

[All the armies of Rohan and the Ents rally to defeat Isengard].

"Wait, but why would Ents care about respecting fires as burning hydrocarbons, if they're made of hydrocarbons?" asks Merry about the Ents, the ancient living trees that can walk and talk.

"Because," the Ent begins, slowly. "It was the ancients who took our branches, sometimes our bodies, yes. But Saruman has destroyed all the forests. The ancients held sacred the Ents, rarely chose Ent over tree for their fire. Those trees that they burned left carbon for Ents to breathe, not from Ent bark. But Saruman, has forsaken the Ents. He doesn't see hydrocarbon from Ent. He burns all."

> "Got it," Saruman says. "Hydrocarbon is not Ent." And he proceeds with his burning.[^6]

And there is an argument to be made that we are all just adjectives on a finite number of elementary particles, or even on just one ubiquitous one, e.g., photon, which, besides its energy absorbed in the human body, is what composes<!--tis compose--> / tis compose [flame](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=difference+between+flame+and+fire&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). 

Different adjectives on the same source.

That [heavy water cares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor)! Smashing together some uranium, as how a primer in a gun strikes (and thereby ignites) gunpowder, expels neutrons that are a bit too unfriendly with other uranium, like how the energy from the electrons do to hydrocarbons, pierces, and starts a hailstorm of other neutrons <!--like it--> flying out of uranium and doing the same, but, alone, too fast for the energy to be captured in the rods of nuclear engines. Heavy water, already full of neutrons, absorbs the impact of that calamity and makes it slow down, while still supplying its own neutron occasionally to sustain the chain reaction, enough that the power can be harnessed. (But should it?)

Though in the creation of helium-4, it (<!--the neutron / stabilization-->caring hydrogen with its extra neutron stabilizing and participating in the reaction of reconfigured electrons, and maybe protons, that emit sunlight, photons, like flame) comes in handy in the [reconfiguration engine for our sun](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Nuclear_fusion_in_the_Sun#:~:text=This%20resulting%20proton%2Dneutron%20pair,and%20are%20released%20as%20sunlight.), where instead of hydrocarbons splitting to produce water, hydrogen conjoin to produce helium and heavy hydrogen! (Fusion energy, that can also be harnessed). (Via solar panels).

Short of some oxygen, the sun is almost water!

No other source teaches so thoroughly what fire, fission, and fusion are in so short, entertaining, and easily readable way, and yet some extremely bad experts might read this, learn a lot in the background, entirely not notice due to how simply the material is explained, and then think the point is something else.
