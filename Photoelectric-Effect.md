# Photoelectric Effect

In order for the photoelectric effect to make sense and for intensity to truly be independent from K.E., everything about photons has to be averaged

The [momentums](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/What-is-Light.md) of proximal photons have to be proximity-averaged

And the electromagnetic effects of proximal photons have to be proximity-averaged

since both affect K.E., and their intensities (quanta) would otherwise [sum](https://qr.ae/psZKjS).

This might be the case but I keep hearing everywhere in the description of the photoelectric effect that intensity is (completely) independent from K.E., meaning that increasing the brightness of a light shouldn't ever push electrons (increasing frequency definitely does), but since momenta sum standardly, there's a contradiction of reasoning unless, for example, they proximity-average rather than sum.
