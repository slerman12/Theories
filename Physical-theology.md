The question of whether physics are intelligent is not one that gets asked, in either the natural sciences or theological circles. Physicists propose an impartial model of the universe that describes its behavior according to stochastic “rules”: if this, then that, approximately. Theologians believe in a God, an intelligent creator governing the universe, but the question of how and where this God “decides” the fates of matter in our physical world is left ambiguous, disconnected from the observable and reproducible patterns described by standard models. To me, it seems like this “separation of church and physics” makes it impossible to reason logically about the philosophical possibility of God in a physically constrained and model-able universe.
